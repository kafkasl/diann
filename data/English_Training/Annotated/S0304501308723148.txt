Abstract
 Objectives
To determine the outcomes of infants born at less than 29 weeks’ gestation, obstetric abnormalities, and the social and familial repercussions of this prematurity.
Material and methods
We retrospectively studied 28 infants, born at less than 29 weeks’ gestation, referred to the Early Healthcare Program of the Cantabrian Government between January 2002 and June 2006.
Results
The main causes of prematurity in this group were chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, and preterm labor.
Of the infants studied, 28.57% had a disability.
<dis>Severe mental retardation</dis> and <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> was found in 37% and <dis>moderate mental retardation</dis> in 24%.
<dis>Bilateral hypacusis</dis>, respiratory alterations and <dis>mild mental retardation</dis> were found in the remainder.
The main social repercussions were a change in family roles, negative economic effects, and heavy emotional burden.
Conclusions
A total of 28.57% of the infants studied had a recognized disability.
No predominant obstetric abnormality was identified.
However, the social and familial repercussions were substantial.
