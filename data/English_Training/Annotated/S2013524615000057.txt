Abstract
 Marchiafava Bignami disease is a rare encephalopathy characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum, with the subsequent atrophy.
It is usually caused by a chronic abuse of alcohol, although it may also have an idiopathic origin or be related to nutritional deficiencies.
It is most frequently seen in middle-aged men with an alcoholism problem (40 to 60 years old), but it has also been described in non-alcoholic men and in females.
Symptoms can show several degrees of mental confusion, <dis>lack of memory</dis>, <dis>impairment of certain cognitive and emotional functions</dis>, signs of inter- hemispheric disconnection, <dis>dysarthria</dis> and <dis>gait impairment</dis>.
The case is presented of a 47-year-old male patient who came to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness and <dis>language impairment</dis>.
After discarding several diagnoses and performing various tests, the MRI showed a hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, consistent with the diagnosis of Marchifava Bignami disease It is important to be aware of this disease for the proper approach by nurses in order to provide good quality care.
