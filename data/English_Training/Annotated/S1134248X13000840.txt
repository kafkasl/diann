Background.
Saiatu is a programme that offers a specially trained in-home social welfare assistance to improve the delivery of care for people with advanced and terminal illness, and their families. 
The following is a presentation of a study carried out following 17 months of work, showing the characteristics of those patients cared for, the place of death, and facts relating to Saiatu's daily activity.

Method.
A cross-sectional, observational descriptive study was conducted in the region of Gipuzkoa.

Population of study: Patients cared for by Saiatu between 1 February 2011 and 30 June 2012.

Inclusion Criteria: Patients who had died before 30 June 2012.

Sample: The whole patient population (70 patients).

Variables and sources of information: Records of identification of patient and main carer, health care information, and date of admission into Saiatu.

Results.
Of the 70 patients cared for, 61.4% were men and 36.8% were women, with a mean age of 76.79 years old. 
In 62.9% of the cases the main carer was the spouse. 
More than half (60%) of the families did not have any public or private social support network, and their level of dependency was found to be severe to moderate in 75.7% of cases.

The large majority (88.6%) of the patients were oncological, and the remainder were non-oncological. 
The majority of cases, 37.1%, were referrals from hospitalisation at home.

Of the 92% who had expressed the wish to die at home, 71.4% had that wish fulfilled. 
However of those who died in hospital, 65% had expressed the wish to die at home. 
Overall 79% died in the place they had previously expressed.

It was observed that age, <dis>dysphagia</dis> and emotional concerns were associated with death at home, whilst anorexia was related to death in hospital.
