Loneliness is a problem that affects a very high percentage of older people, and can lead to <dis>physical and/or mental illness</dis>. 
This article aims to present a systematic review of programs to combat loneliness directed towards the institutionalised elderly. 
Experimental and quasi-experimental articles published between 2000 and 2016 were included in the review. 
An analysis was carried out on the quality of the methodological evidence of each of the articles. 
The programs analysed included animal-assisted, contacts with families through videoconferencing, gardening and/or horticulture workshops, reminiscence therapies, humour therapies, and cognitive interventions. 
The results show that intervention programs are effective to reduce the feeling of loneliness. 
The methodological limitations of the studies are discussed and future research is recommended.
