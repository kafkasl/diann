Abstract
 Fahr disease is a syndrome of unknown etiology, consisting of bilateral idiopathic calcifications of basal ganglia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
We describe the case of a 70 year old man with no psychiatric background, admitted to the hospital due to the presence of depressive symptoms with economic and guilt delusions and suicidal idea.
He suffered a depression 3 years ago that completely resolved with mirtazapine, and calcifications of basal ganglia were a casual finding in the CT.
In the current hospital admission, the lack of efficacy of antidepressant, antipsychotic and anxiolytic treatment lead to a severe melancholy stupor that indicated electroconvulsive therapy, which controlled both the psychotic and affective symptoms, but a <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> state was observed once the psychiatric symptoms resolved.
