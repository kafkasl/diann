Introduction
Few studies have validated the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) test in Latin American populations.
Objetive
To evaluate the psychometric properties and discriminant validity of the MoCA-S in elderly patients in Santiago de Chile.
Methods
172 individuals were grouped according to their clinical diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale as follows: <dis>amnestic mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>aMCI</dis>; n±24), <dis>non-amnestic MCI</dis> (<dis>naMCI</dis>; n±24), <dis>mild dementia</dis> (n±20), and cognitively normal (n±104). 
Participants were evaluated with both the MoCA-S and the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) to determine the discriminant validity of the MoCA-S.
Results
Mean age and years of schooling were 73±6 and 11±4 years, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences. 
The MoCA-S displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.772), high inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.846; P<.01), and high intra-rater reliability (test-retest reliability coefficient: 0.922; P<.001). 
The MoCA-S was found to be an effective and valid test for detecting <dis>aMCI</dis> (AUC±0.903) and <dis>mild dementia</dis> (AUC±0.957); its effectiveness for detecting <dis>naMCI</dis> was lower (AUC±0.629). 
The optimal cut-off points for <dis>aMCI</dis> and <dis>mild dementia</dis> were<21 and<20, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 75% and 82% for <dis>aMCI</dis> and 90% and 86% for <dis>mild dementia</dis>. 
The level of education had a great impact on scores: as a result, 2 points were added for patients with less than 8 years of schooling and one point for patients with 8-12 years of schooling (MoCA-S1-2). 
The MoCA-S1-2 showed significantly greater discriminant validity than the MMSE for differentiating aMCI from <dis>dementia</dis>.
Conclusions
The MoCA-S1-2 is a short, easy-to-use, and useful test for diagnosing <dis>aMCI</dis> and <dis>mild dementia</dis>.
