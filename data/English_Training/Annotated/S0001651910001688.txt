Abstract
 Introduction
The A1555G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation is responsible for <dis>maternally inherited non-syndromic hearing loss</dis> that is increased by aminoglycoside exposure.
The objective of this study was to ascertain the frequency of the A1555G mutation among patients without family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis> or known exposition to aminoglycosides.
Methods
We screened for the mtDNA A1555G mutation in Spanish patients with <dis>sporadic sensorineural hearing impairment</dis> without a known family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis> or aminoglycoside exposition seen at the ENT Department in Sierrallana Hospital (Torrelavega, Cantabria, Spain) over a four-year period.
Results
A total of 219 patients with <dis>bilateral hearing loss</dis> were screened.
Two of them (0.9%) had the A1555G mitochondrial DNA mutation.
Both patients had a <dis>moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss for low frequency</dis>, and moderate to severe loss for high-frequency.
Conclusions
The mtDNA A1555G mutation in patients with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> without family history of <dis>deafness</dis> or aminoglycoside ototoxicity is infrequent in our region.
We should suspect this mutation in patients younger than 50 years old, with <dis>postlingual bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> that is more pronounced at high frequency.
