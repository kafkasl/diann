Abstract
 We show two atypical Coganâ€™s syndrome cases in forty-seven and fifty-six years old individuals.
Characteristical symptoms of the syndrome were detected in both (interstitial keratitis, <dis>sensorineural deafness</dis> and vestibular dysfunction), but they could be considered as unusual because of the association of sistematic symptoms and an onset with <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
In both cases there was an increase in erythrosedimentation rate and immunoglobulins leveles, as well as high titles for rheumatoid factor and non-specific autoantibodies.
By means of a Western-blot technique, several choclear antibodies with distinct molecular weight were detected, but the 68 KD appeared in both.
Metil-prednisolone treatmen did not avoid ocular and auditive reactivation in ne of the patients.
