In adolescence and adulthood, problems are centered on <dis>behavioral disorders</dis>, absence of satiety, and <dis>mild to moderate mental retardation</dis>.
In the past two decades remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of its clinical manifestations and natural history, and treatments have been developed, such as growth hormone therapy and the use of psychoactive drugs, which can improve quality of life in these patients.
