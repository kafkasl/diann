Abstract
 The latest scientific literature considers early diagnosis of <dis>deafness</dis> as the key element to define the educational and inclusive prognosis of the <dis>deaf</dis> child, because it allows taking advantage of the critical period of development (0â€“4 years).
Highly significant differences exist between <dis>deaf</dis> people who have been stimulated early and those who have received late or improper intervention.
Early identification of late-onset disorders requires special attention and knowledge on the part of every childcare professional.
Programmes and additional actions beyond neonatal screening should be designed and planned to ensure that every child with a <dis>significant hearing loss</dis> is detected early.
For this purpose, the CODEPEH would like to highlight the need for continuous monitoring of children's auditory health.
Consequently, CODEPEH has drafted the recommendations included in the present document.
