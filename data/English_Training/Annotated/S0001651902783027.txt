Abstract
 A69-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of <dis>dysphagia</dis> and a hard overgrowth of the right palatine tonsil visible in oral examination.
Computerized Tomography scan showed a big calcified lesion inside the tonsil not seen in a pharyngoscopy.
Tonsillectomy was performed and a giant tonsillolith was found inside the resected piece.
The calculus was 3x2x2.3 cm and with an irregular-pyramidal shape.
Normal tonsillar tissue with many colonies of Actionomyces inside the tonsillar crypts was the definitive pathological feature.
