Objective.
To analyse of the relationship between burden of illness and coping strategies and the demographic variables of caregivers, and the demographic and clinical variables of people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Methods.
Multicentre correlational cross-sectional study including 70 people diagnosed with schizophrenia, or a schizoaffective disorder, and 70 primary informal caregivers. 
They were evaluated using Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory, Family Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the brief Disability Assessment Scale.

Results.
Burden of illness positively associated with patient <dis>impairment in occupational and social functioning</dis>, and negatively with education level. 
Avoidance, coercion and positive communication were positively associated with <dis>impairment in occupational and social functioning</dis> of patients. 
Social interest and friendships showed a positive association with the education level of caregivers. 
Spiritual assistance negatively correlated with <dis>impairment in social functioning</dis> and patient age, and resignation was negatively associated with length of the disorder and patient education level.

Conclusions.
Burden and dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance and coercion, are associated with <dis>functional impairment</dis> of the patient. 
These findings suggest the need to provide support to caregivers, adjusted to the functional level of the patient, in order to prevent burden of care.
