Abstract
 Introduction
In this study we have analyzed (i) the audiometric frequencies more often affected in acoustic neuroma (AN), (ii) the percentage of patients presenting normal hearing and those with <dis>sudden hearing loss</dis>, (iii) if there is a correlation between tumor size and <dis>hearing loss</dis>, and (iv) the relationship between clinical and radiological parameters and audiological data.
Methods and Material
Retrospective study of 81 patients undergoing surgical removal of a sporadic AN.
Results
The highest threshold in the tumorÂ´s ear was found at 8000 Hz, and the highest interaural difference at 4000 Hz.
The percentage of patients presenting normal hearing and <dis>sudden hearing loss</dis> was 2.5% and 9%, respectively.
No significant association was found between tumor size and <dis>hearing loss</dis>, preoperative facial palsy or Vth cranial nerve deficit.
There was a significant association between the degree of <dis>hearing loss</dis> and Vth cranial nerve deficit, and between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and preoperative facial palsy.
Conclusions
The association between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and Vth cranial nerve deficit, and between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and preoperative facial palsy is independent the size of the tumour.
