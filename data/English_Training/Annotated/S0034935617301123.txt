Multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a group of complex disorders that include <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, chronic fatigue and/or respiratory problems. 
This syndrome could be triggered by specific allergens and toxins that cause neurophysiological sensitization and the appearance of the clinical symptomatology. 
Anaesthesia for these patients always poses a challenge for the anaesthetist, because they need to find and use drugs that do not trigger or aggravate the symptoms of the disease. 
Therefore, sevoflurane in these circumstances might be “the ideal anaesthetic”. 
Performing general anaesthesia with sevoflurane as the sole anaesthetic agent, together with a series of environmental measures formed the basis for successful anaesthesia and surgery in our patient with a multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome.
