Introduction.
Diagnosing and treating <dis>autism</dis> and child psychoses is very difficult; these pathologies impact not only the child's life but also the family as a whole. 
Therefore caution is required when giving a diagnosis with prognostic implications. 
We use the psychodynamic perspective in order to take into consideration both pathological and healthy diagnostic aspects, and to promote evolutionary potential of each patient.

Objective.
To determine the inter-rater reliability and to test quantitatively and qualitatively the variables involved in the diagnoses of patients with suspected <dis>autism</dis> and child psychoses, based upon psychodynamic concepts.

Methods.
An inter-rater reliability study was carried on, based upon the diagnostic evaluation of videos of patients with suspected <dis>autism</dis> or child psychoses who attended the diagnostic meeting (observation session) at the Instituto de Ortopedia Infantil Roosevelt.

Results.
Kappa values were obtained, ranging from .24 to .50, with a reliability force varying from slight to moderate, and κ=.24 for personality organization. 
This type of diagnosis takes into account both the pathological and healthy aspects which make up personality organization. 
Finally, limitations and aspects that should be considered in further studies were discussed.

Conclusions.
The results reinforce the need to evaluate a child with major disorders in an interdisciplinary team, and but a single observer, in order to allow discussion, and debate, and therefore, avoid partial readings of the patient’ s psychological functioning.
