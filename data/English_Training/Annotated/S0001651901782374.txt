Abstract
We report on nine cases with jugular dehiscence in middle ear diagnosticated and followed up in our clinic from 1987 to 2000.
Diagnosis was made, in some cases, when carrying out an otoscopy and others by clinical sintomatology, otomicroscopically imaging, audiometry, ct-scan and mri.
All patients were affected of <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Some of them also suffered pulsatile tinnitus and even vertigo.
The follow up of all patients has been stable and devoid of bleeding complications
