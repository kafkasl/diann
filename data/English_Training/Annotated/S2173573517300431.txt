Abstract
 Introduction and objective
Sixty percent of <dis>prelingual hearing loss</dis> is of genetic origin.
A family history of <dis>permanent childhood hearing loss</dis> is a risk factor.
The objective of the study is to determine the relationship between this risk factor and <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
We have evaluated clinical and epidemiological characteristics and related nonsyndromic genetic variation.
Material and method
This was a retrospective, descriptive and observational study of newborns between January 2007 and December 2010 with family history as risk factor for <dis>hearing loss</dis> using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response.
Results
A total of 26,717 children were born.
Eight hundred and fifty-seven (3.2%) had family history.
Fifty-seven (0.21%) failed to pass the second test.
A percentage of 29.1 (n=16) had another risk factor, and 17.8% (n=9) had no classical risk factor.
No risk factor was related to the <dis>hearing loss</dis> except heart disease.
Seventy-six point four percent had normal hearing and 23.6% <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
The mean of family members with <dis>hearing loss</dis> was 1.25.
On genetic testing, 82.86% of homozygotes was normal, 11.43% heterozygosity in Connexin 26 gene (35delG), 2.86% R143W heterozygosity in the same gene and 2.86% mutant homozygotes (35delG).
We found no relationship between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and mutated allele.
Conclusions
The percentage of children with a family history and <dis>hearing loss</dis> is higher than expected in the general population.
The genetic profile requires updating to clarify the relationship between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and heart disease, family history and the low prevalence in the mutations analyzed.
