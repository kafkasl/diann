Introduction
Periodontal disease and <dis>dementia</dis> are very prevalent, especially in elderly populations. 
Multiple studies have shown a link between these diseases; however, the conditions are highly heterogeneous and so is the diagnostic methodology, which may hinder interpretation and comparison of the results. 
The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of the literature linking these 2 processes.
Development
We retrieved 22 studies, most of which were retrospective, and analysed various methodological variables including study population, diagnosis of periodontitis, definition of <dis>dementia</dis>, adjusted variables, and results. 
The different aetiopathogenic mechanisms that may affect the progression and interaction of these 2 conditions were also analysed.
Conclusions
Although available evidence indicates a positive association between periodontitis and <dis>dementia</dis>, both the strength of that association and the presence of a causal relationship have yet to be determined.
