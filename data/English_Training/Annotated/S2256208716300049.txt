Abstract
 Prader–Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia, obesity, short stature, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, hyperphagia, hypogonadism and low life expectancy.
We describe the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Prader–Willi syndrome scheduled for bariatric surgery.
Anesthetic considerations are reviewed highlighting perioperative complications associated with this syndrome.
