Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of <dis>dementia</dis> in the elderly population. 
Currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent or delay the natural course of the disease. 
Numerous studies have provided information about the molecular processes underlying biological ageing and, perhaps more importantly, potential interventions to slow ageing and promote healthy longevity in laboratory model systems. 
The main issue addressed in this review is whether an intervention that has anti-ageing properties can alter the appearance and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which age is the biggest risk factor. 
Different anti-ageing interventions have been shown to prevent (and in some cases possibly restore) several parameters recognised as central symptoms to the development of Alzheimer's disease. 
In addition, they are taking the first steps towards translating these laboratory discoveries into clinical applications.
