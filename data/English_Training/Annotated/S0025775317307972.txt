The encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is characterized by the presence of antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of this receptor, resulting in symptoms that are similar to those observed in models of genetic or pharmacologic reduction of NMDARs. 
Patients are usually young adults, predominantly women, and children who develop, in a sequential manner, rapidly progressive symptoms including psychosis, <dis>abnormal movements</dis>, <dis>autonomic dysfunction</dis>, and coma. 
Epileptic seizures are variable and can occur throughout the course of the disease. 
The disease is often mistaken as viral encephalitis, <dis>primary psychiatric disorders</dis>, drug abuse, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
About 50% of young women have an ovarian teratoma; in young girls and men the presence of a tumour is infrequent. 
In some patients, the disease is triggered by herpes simplex encephalitis. 
The recognition of anti-NMDAR encephalitis is important because, despite its severity, most patients respond to immunotherapy.
