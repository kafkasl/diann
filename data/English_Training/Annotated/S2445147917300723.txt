Abstract
 <dis>Deafblindness</dis> is a disability resulting from the combination of <dis>visual and auditory sensory impairments</dis>, which can manifest in different levels causing <dis>special communication problems</dis>.
<dis>Deafblind</dis> people have special needs that derive from <dis>difficulties in sensing, understanding, attention</dis> and a <dis>lack of the skills required to function effectively in society</dis>.
<dis>Deafblindness</dis> requires specialised services, personnel specifically trained in its care and special methods for communication.
Objective
The main objective of this study is to explore the experiences of <dis>deafblind</dis> people in relation to health care throughout their lives.
This study was developed at the St. Ángela de la Cruz Centre, belonging to the Association of Parents of Deafblind People in Spain.
Method
Phenomenological qualitative study, through semi-structured interviews with <dis>deafblind</dis> people at the St. Ángela de la Cruz Centre, Salteras (Seville), carried out in 2015, with the help of interpreters in Spanish sign language.
Topics covered in the interviews refer to facilities, human resources, time waiting and health care.
Results
Coinciding statements were obtained, where the participants point out architectural and educational barriers in health care and stand out better if the professionals know sign language.
Conclusions
It can be highlighted that healthcare professionals lack knowledge of all aspects of <dis>deafblindness</dis>, sign language in particular, and there is a shortage of signs and information for the <dis>deafblind</dis>.
Moreover, alternatives are required to reduce waiting times and improve direct communication with health professionals.
