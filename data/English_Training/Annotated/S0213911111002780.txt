Abstract
 Objectives
To quantify the use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in Spain on the basis of published reports, and to compare this use with that in other European countries.
Methods
We reviewed the scientific literature published by, or with the participation of, authors having Spanish institutional affiliations in Spanish or international journals between May 2001 and June 2010.
Results
A total of 47 papers were identified, with a recent annual increase in those published in English.
There was a predominance of theoretical journals (53.1%) and those specializing in mental health, rehabilitation and disability, with a medium or low impact factor.
The World Health Organization-Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-II) was used in 27.6% of publications.
Most studies addressed adult populations with <dis>mental illness</dis>.
Spain ranked midway in the table of European countries (fifth by Medline references).
Conclusions
This review suggests that the effective application of the ICF in Spain is limited but is increasing and is internationally co-ordinated.
The main fields of application are theoretical and diagnostic, in various clinical, rehabilitation and population-based contexts and, to a much lesser extent, in health services.
