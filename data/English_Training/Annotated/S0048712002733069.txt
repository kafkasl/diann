Summary
Cranioencephalic traumatism is an important cause of morbidity-mortality between the infant and child population and a frequent cause of acquired disability in this population.
In small children, it generally occurs due to falls, being hit by a car or bicycle accidents and in adolescents due to traffic accidents.
The most common neurological complications are spacticity, <dis>ataxia</dis>, tremor and <dis>hemiparesis</dis>.
Speech disorders, principally in form of <dis>expression deficits</dis> and performance of verbal response, can be observed.
<dis>Neuropsychological disorders</dis> such as <dis>attention, memory and concentration deficits</dis> are frequent and <dis>behavior disorders</dis> such as apathy, lack of initiative, emotional lability, depression and aggresivity among others can be associated.
In general, there is good motor recovery, however neuropsychological deficits generally persist for a prolonged time.
The predictive factors of the functional results are related with the severity of the injury, age of the child and prelesional circumstances.
A rehabilitation program aimed at treating both the motor as well as neuropsychological sequels early should be established.
In this paper, we approach cranioencephalic traumatism in the child and adolescent globally, analyzing the sequels and their treatment, and giving special attention to the repercussion of them on growth, due to the typical characteristics of age.
