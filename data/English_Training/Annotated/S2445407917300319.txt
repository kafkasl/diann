Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a prevalent, disabling syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and symptoms such as <dis>sleep disturbance</dis>, fatigue, stiffness, distress, <dis>cognitive impairments</dis> and a high comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders. 
Although no curative treatment has yet been found, various therapeutic approaches have been developed in the fields of pharmacology and psychology. 
The present paper aims to offer a narrative review and a description for clinicians and researchers of psychological therapies that have been applied in a format group in FMS with strong or promising empirical support: i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Psychoeducational program for FMS (FibroQoL), Amygdala Retraining Therapy (ART), and Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (ABCT). 
This review will offer a brief practical summary of each therapy protocol (session-by-session), their rationale and available evidence of their effectiveness.
