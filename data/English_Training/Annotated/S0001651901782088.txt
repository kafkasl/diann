Abstract
The aim of this study was to examine the results of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (Teoae) as screening test for <dis>hearing impairment</dis> in newborn infants.
We examined 9.951 of 11.405 infants born in our city from January 1st, (1995), to December 31st, (1998).
A Teoae test was performed prior to discharge and repeated one week later in cases who failed the first Teoae.
In case of suspected <dis>hearing loss</dis> auditory brainstem response (Abr) was performed 3 months later.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was defined as Abr threshold >20 Db.
157 infants (1,5%) were identified with <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Screening with Teoae was sufficiently sensitive in identification of <dis>congenital hearing impairment</dis> and the efficacy increased with the experience.
