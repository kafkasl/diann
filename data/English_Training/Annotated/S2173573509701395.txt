Abstract
 Objective
To identify and describe <dis>peripheral and central audiological abnormalities</dis> of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.
Materials and methods
Prospective, cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study.
Vogt-Koyanagi- Harada patients referred from an ophthalmologic centre were assessed for signs and symptoms of auditory pathology.
Peripheral audiological and central auditory processing tests were performed.
To standardize the latter, methodological controls were matched for sex, age and audiometric chart.
Results
Twenty-one patients were included (3 male, 18 female); mean age, 40.7 (11.82) years.
Nine of the 21 complained of tinnitus and 9 suspected <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Exclusively or mainly sensorial abnormalities on the pure tone audiometry chart were documented in 61.9% (mainly selective troughs at 4 and 8 kHz); 95.3% of patients had deficit in high-frequency audiometry.
Five of the patients had <dis>sensorial disorders</dis> in the speech audiometry.
No central auditory processing disorder was seen.
Conclusions
Most of the patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome had <dis>objective peripheral audiological abnormalities</dis>, although few revealed any symptoms.
