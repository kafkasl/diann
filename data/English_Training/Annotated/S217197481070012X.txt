Abstract
 Introduction
The emotional sphere and its relationships with sexual identity and awareness of disability in a person with Down syndrome (DS).
Case report
25-year-old woman with DS who has a psychotic episode with delusions when a tubal ligation is being considered.
The condition arises due to a conflict between sexuality and identity.
Discussion
People with Down's syndrome can undergo unharmonious development or remain anchored in previous evolutionary stages.
This situation, together with difficulties to symbolise, can lead to <dis>psychotic mental disorders</dis>, as in this case.
