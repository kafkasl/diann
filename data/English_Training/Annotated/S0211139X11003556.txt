Abstract
 Objective
To determine prevalence and clinical characteristics of elderly diabetic patients in nursing homes.
Material and method
Observational and multicentre study in 14 nursing homes in CÃ¡diz (Spain).
Study variables: age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, duration of diabetes, complications, macrovascular complications, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
Metabolic control: frequency of baseline blood glucose and HbA1c determinations.
Metabolic complications suffered.
Treatment: oral and type of antidiabetics, insulinisation.
Diabetes education.
Functional and mental assessment using Barthel index and MMT.
Data was analysed using SPSS v17.0.
Results
A total of 1952 elderly institutionalised patients were studied, with a diabetes prevalence of 26.44%.
The study included 312 patients with a mean age of 79.7 years, of whom 57.4% were women, and 66.9% knew of their diagnosis of diabetes for over 10 years.
Vascular events were suffered by 55.1%, with the most common being ischaemic stroke (55.2%), followed by myocardial infarction (18%) and 14.5% with peripheral arterial disease.
There were 29.6% with retinopathy, 21.3% diabetic nephropathy, and 25.6% suffering from distal symmetric polyneuropathy.
HbA1c analysis was performed in 90.1% of patients, with 50% levels between 7 and 9%, with a six-monthly assessment rate of 63.4%.
Metabolic complications: diabetic ketoacidosis 7.1%, hyperosmolar syndrome 2.9%, and 15.7% symptomatic hypoglycaemia.
Oral hypoglycaemic agents were being taken by 66% of patients, with the most frequently used being metformin (55.3%) followed by gliclazide and repaglinide (10.2%, 3.4%, respectively).
50.2% were insulinised.
45.6% <dis>functional dependence</dis>.
Barthel Index average of 48.4 points, with 46.1% diagnosed with <dis>dementia</dis>, moderate state, 36.7%.
Conclusions
Diabetic prevalence in nursing homes is high, and institutionalised patients are elderly, long-standing diabetics, with both macro- and microvascular complications, and have a <dis>significant level of mental and functional disabilities</dis>.
