Introduction
Several US studies have investigated the criminal behaviour among homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>. 
But to date, no studies have been carried out in Spain.
Method
A retrospective observational study was conducted on a sample of 118 patients selected from a psychiatric care program for homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>. 
Factors associated with criminal behaviour were analysed by comparing 2 groups, with and without criminal records.
Results
Of the total sample studied, 24.6% had a criminal record, and 58.6% of them had entered prison. 
Significant differences between groups were found for the variables of gender, pending sentences, duration of homelessness, multiple substance use, disease awareness, and severity of psychotic symptoms.
Conclusions
In the population of homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>, regardless of gender, the co-existence of comorbidity with multiple substance use, and a prolonged duration of homelessness, is the most important risk factor for criminal behaviour.
