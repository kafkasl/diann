Abstract
 Introduction
Fragile X syndrome is an inherited form of <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
It results from an abnormally expanded number of trinucleotide CGG repeats.
Some grandfathers of these children become forgetful, have frequent falls and other neurological problems.
Researchers have found a connection between fragile X syndrome and the neurological symptoms in elderly men.
This resulted in the recognition of a syndrome originally referred to as “intention tremor, parkinsonism and generalised brain atrophy in carriers of a fragile X premutation”.
This premutation is also associated with premature ovarian failure.
Methodology
This paper reviews the literature on the neurological signs of fragile X premutation.
Conclusions
Fragile X premutation is a risk for <dis>movement disorders</dis> and <dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis> and it should be considered in patients with a family history of <dis>mental retardation</dis> or <dis>autism</dis>, and particularly in those females with premature ovarian failure.
