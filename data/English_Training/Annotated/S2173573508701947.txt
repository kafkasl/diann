There are many different vertigo classifications and different denominations are frequently used for the same clinical processes.
The Otoneurology Committee of the Spanish Society for Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Pathology proposes an eminently practical classification of peripheral vertigo to facilitate a common terminology that can be easily used by general ENT practitioners.
The methodology used has been by consensus within our society and especially among the most outstanding work groups in the area of otoneurology in Spain.
Initially vertigo is divided into single-episode vertigo and recurring attacks of vertigo, and these are then sub-divided into 2 groups, depending on whether or not <dis>hearing loss</dis> is present.
Acute vertigo <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp> corresponds to vestibular neuritis and if it is associated with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, it is due to labyrinthitis of different aetiologies and cochleovestibular neuritis.
Recurrent vertigos <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp> are classified as induced, either by posture (BPPV) or pressure (perilymphatic fistula), or as spontaneous, including migraine-associated vertigo, metabolic vertigo, childhood paroxysmal vertigo, and vertigo of vascular causes (TIAs, vertebrobasilar insufficiency).
Finally, recurrent vertigo with <dis>hearing loss</dis> includes Ménière's disease and others such as vertigomigraine (with <dis>hearing loss</dis>), autoimmune pathology of the inner ear, syphilitic infection, and perilymphatic fistula (with <dis>hearing loss</dis>).
