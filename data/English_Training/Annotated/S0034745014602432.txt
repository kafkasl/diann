Abstract
 Introduction
Mortality rates in patients suffering from burns have decreased, and the challenge now is quality of life of survivors, who have a high prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Objective
To describe the prevalence of depersonalization disorder in burned patients.
Methods
Review of the literature published on the subject, using the databases Medline, Ovid and Tripdatabase.
Results
It is well documented that dissociative symptoms including depersonalization accompany acute stress reactions that are triggered by major trauma, and that cognitive styles predispose certain individuals exposed to trauma to develop psychopathology, mostly posttraumatic stress disorder.
Conclusion
Despite this knowledge few studies have been conducted to establish the prevalence of phenomena of depersonalization-derealization in burned patients.
