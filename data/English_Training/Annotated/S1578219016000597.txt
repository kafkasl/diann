Abstract
 Many skin diseases are associated with <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
When the psychological symptoms are mild, as is often the case in dermatology, it can be difficult to distinguish between normality and the manifestations of a <dis>mental disorder</dis>.
To facilitate the distinction we review the concept of <dis>mental disorder</dis> in the present article.
It is also important to have instruments that can facilitate early detection of <dis>psychological disease</dis>, i.e. when the symptoms are still mild.
Short, simple, self-administered questionnaires have been developed to help dermatologists and other health professionals identify the presence of a <dis>mental disorder</dis> with a high degree of certainty.
In this article, we focus on the questionnaires most often used to detect the 2 most common <dis>mental disorders</dis>: anxiety and depression.
Finally, we describe the circumstances in which it is advisable to refer a dermatological patient to a psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat the <dis>mental disorder</dis> in accordance with standard protocols.
