Introduction.
Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome with severe consequences, especially for elderly patients with <dis>pre-existing cognitive impairment</dis>.

Methodology.
Descriptive study of one retrospective cohort, with the aim of comparing risk factors and mortality between surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment in a group of hospitalised patients with delirium.

Results.
Of the 184 hospitalised patients with delirium analysed, 29.3% were for surgical causes and 70.7% for non-surgical causes. 
Just over half (50.5%) were women, and 50% of the patients were 74 years or less (interquartile range, 27 years), with statistical differences (P=.002). 
Prior <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was observed in 42.9% of patients, with a greater proportion of non-surgical (50.8% vs 24.1%) with significant differences (P=.001). 
Anticholinergic medications were received by 89.7% of patients, and almost all of them (99.5%) received three or more medicines, with no significant differences. 
Half (50%) of the patients remained in hospital for 16.3 days or less (interquartile range, 23 days). 
Hospitalisation was significantly longer in the surgical group (P<.001). 
The hospital mortality was 14.7%, with no statistical differences between groups (P=.073).

Discussion.
Although there were no significant differences in mortality between the groups, it was higher in the non-surgical (17.7% vs. 7.4%). 
Increased mortality was found in the older group (non-surgical) that also had significantly greater <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, which coincides with that in the scientific literature.
