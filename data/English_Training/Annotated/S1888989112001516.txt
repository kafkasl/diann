Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Functional deficits</dis> are commonly observed in bipolar disorder after symptomatic remission.
<dis>Social cognition deficits</dis> have also been reported, which could contribute to dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorder in remission.
Material and methods
Twelve bipolar disorder patients in symptomatic remission (7 patients with bipolar disorder type I and 5 with bipolar disorder type II) and 12 healthy controls completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Faux Pas Test to evaluate theory of mind (ToM).
Both groups also completed the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST).
Results
The performance of the bipolar patients in the cognitive component of ToM was below normal, although the difference between the control group was not statistically significant ( _P_ = .078), with a trend to a worse performance associated with a higher number of depressive episodes ( _P_ = .082).
There were no statistically significant differences between groups for the emotional component of ToM.
Global functionality was significantly lower in bipolar patients compared to the control group ( _P_ = .001).
Significant differences were also observed between both groups in five of the six dimensions of functionality assessed.
No significant correlation was found between functionality and theory of mind.
Conclusions
Bipolar patients in symptomatic remission exhibit <dis>impairments in several areas of functioning</dis>.
Cognitive ToM appears more affected than emotional ToM.
Deficits in ToM were not related to <dis>functional impairment</dis>.
