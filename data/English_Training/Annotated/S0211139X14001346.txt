Abstract
 Introduction
The purpose of this study is to determine the opinion of professionals working in residential aged care facilities on the regulation of sexuality in these settings.
Materials and methods
Fifty-three professionals from five residential aged care facilities located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona answered several questions regarding the advisability of establishing measures for the regulation of sexuality in RACFs, the elements that could contribute to this, and the aspects that such regulations should consider.
Results
Around 50% of the participants recognized the advisability of having some type of measures for sexuality regulation in residential aged care facilities.
According to their responses this should be developed taking into account professional opinions, but also the points of view of the residents and their relatives.
The most frequently mentioned regulations were those that ensured that any kind of sexually charged situation occurred in a private environment.
The development of strategies are suggested to distinguish those people with <dis>dementia</dis> that are competent to consent to sexual acts from those who are not.
Conclusions
The opinion of professionals working in RACFs regarding the advisability of establishing measures for sexuality regulation seems to be considerably divided.
Thus, whilst around 50% of them recognize their potential usefulness, the other half consider them unnecessary or even counterproductive for the sexual freedom of residents.
Associating regulation with prohibition and sexuality with sexual activity was not uncommon among the responses of the participants.
