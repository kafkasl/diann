Abstract
 Introduction
Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disease characterized by <dis>motor, behavioral and cognitive disturbances</dis>.
<dis>Dysphagia</dis> is a common and life-threatening symptom of the disease leading to nutritional deficiencies and a high risk of bronchoaspiration.
Our objective was to study swallowing dysfunction and to present a specific intervention to improve or maintain swallowing efficiency.
Materials and methods
We recruited 10 ambulatory HD patients aged between 46 and 79 years old, with a moderate stage of the disease, who were compared with 10 age- and gender- matched healthy controls.
The safety and effectiveness of the oral and pharyngeal phases was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively through the volume-viscosity swallow test.
Results
We observed ineffective lip closure in 6 patients, oral residue in 4, repetitive swallows in 10, pharyngeal residue in 7, cough in 3, voice changes in 6, and a drop of 2 points in blood oxygen saturation in a further 3.
Controls scored between 60 and 63 points, while patients scored between 19 and 53 points.
Conclusions
The oral and pharyngeal swallowing phases are already compromised in moderate stages of HD.
We hypothesize that a specific rehabilitation program for <dis>dysphagia</dis> could improve <dis>swallowing difficulties</dis> and contribute to maintaining nutritional status in affected individuals.
Consequently, we propose a rehabilitation program including orolingual praxis and specific muscular postural strategies.
