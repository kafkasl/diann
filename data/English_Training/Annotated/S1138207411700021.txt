Abstract
 People with a <dis>learning disability</dis> are living longer.
This increased longevity brings with it the conditions of older age including <dis>dementia</dis>.
Amongst people in the general population who have <dis>dementia</dis> there is inadequate pain recognition and treatment.
Limited research has been undertaken on the pain management needs of people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis>, yet they will experience high levels of physical health needs that will, as a consequence, result in pain.
The research study ‘Responding to the Pain needs of People with a Learning Disability and Dementia’ explored the detection, management and understanding of pain amongst a range of professional groups involved in supporting people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis>.
The study also recorded the experiences and views of some people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who had <dis>dementia</dis>.
The dilemmas and obstacles to effective pain management were explored.
It was found that the pain experiences and management of people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis> mirrored findings in the general population.
The research did, however, identify extra and compounding issues in relation to people with a <dis>learning disability</dis>.
Drawing on this research this article outlines recommendations for practitioners and service providers and discusses the key lessons for responding more effectively to pain in people with Down’s syndrome and <dis>dementia</dis>.
