Introduction
Retinophaty of prematurity (ROP) is a disease in which abnormal neovascularization develops in the retina and could be a cause of <dis>blindness</dis>.
Objective
To determine severe ROP prevalence.
Material and methods
In this retrospective, observational, descriptive, transverse study, we did a review of the clinical records of premature patients with < 34 weeks of gestation and a birth weight  1,750g if they have risk factors for ROP. 
From 2005 to 2014, all the newborns were examined by a retinologist. 
ROP prevalence per year was determined, only the prevalence for severe ROP was compared because it requires treatment and has a high risk for <dis>blidness</dis>.
Results
One hundred forty-three newborns were included, 29 (20.2%) had severe ROP. 
When comparing for years there was a peak during 2005, with a descend in the prevalence of severe ROP in 2014, so in ten years there was a downward trend.
Conclusions
Severe ROP cumulated prevalence was 20.2%, similar to that observed in other latinoamerican countries. 
The high prevalence observed from 2005 to 2009, is explained because we examined patients refered from other institutions without screening programs for ROP. 
In 2010 we observed a descend in the prevalence, because only patient from our institution were included. 
From 2011 to 2014 we report <scp><neg>none</neg> <dis>blind</dis> children with ROP</scp>.
