Abstract
 Introduction
Ménière's disease is characterised by vertigo, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and tinnitus.
Various studies assess the problem of vertigo and audition deficit in Ménière's disease, but only a few of these relate to the clinical characteristics of tinnitus, the aim of this study.
Material and methods
A transversal descriptive study of the behaviour of tinnitus in 88 patients in different stages of Ménière's disease treated in a tertiary hospital was carried out.
The different characteristics of disease were analysed: intensity was evaluated with an analogue-visual scale, subjective tonality through tonal shade references, the impact on the patient's quality of life was tested by a self-appraisal questionnaire, and competence level was evaluated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory.
Epidemiologic factors, personal records, hearing thresholds and evolution in the number of vertiginous crises in the previous six months were also taken into account.
Results
The average time of evolution of the disease was 15.4 years.
The results evidence the development of tinnitus of moderate intensity (5/10) and low frequency (46%), with a slight impact on quality of life.
Worsening in the quality of life related to hearing affectation and/or advanced stages of the disease was also observed.
We identified high frequency tonality, a medical record of depression and youth as unfavourable prognostic factors.
There was no relationship found with the years of evolution of the disease or with the number of vertigo crises.
Conclusion
In large samples of long evolution Ménière's disease, patients do not perceive tinnitus as a problem that produces serious impairment in their quality of life.
