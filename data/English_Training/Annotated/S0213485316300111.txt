Introduction
<dis>Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia</dis> (<dis>BPSD</dis>), present in the vast majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), cause <dis>extensive impairment in all areas, including functionality</dis>. 
Early diagnosis and management are critical, especially since these symptoms are not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a diagnostic criterion of AD, but only as specific features of some patients. 
The main purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of these behavioural and psychological symptoms of <dis>dementia</dis>, particularly in AD. 
In addition, we discuss why these symptoms have not been included in the latest DSM-V.
Development
We conducted a literature search through various databases to gather data about <dis>BPSD</dis> in AD, and found a total of 12 articles.
Conclusions
BPSD are present in almost all patients and result in <dis>cognitive and functional impairment</dis>. 
The prevalence of these symptoms varies depending on the study and the symptom in question. 
In our view, <dis>BPSD</dis> should be included among the DSM diagnostic criteria for AD.
