Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous syndrome often associated with <dis>specific cognitive deficits</dis> that are rarely monitored during follow-up of these patients.
Objective
The purpose of our study is two-fold. 
First, we aimed to describe the cognitive profile of patients with NF1 and detect <dis>disorders in higher brain functions</dis> associated with the disease.
Second, we identified the reasons for consultation associated with school performance in these patients.
Methods
We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of 24 paediatric patients (ages 5 to 16) with NF1 who underwent neuropsychological assessment.
Results
The most frequent reasons for consultation were <dis>attention deficits</dis> (58.33%), <dis>learning disorders</dis> (25%), poor motor coordination (25%), and <dis>language impairment</dis> (0.8%). 
Although 96% of the patients displayed impairments in at least one of the assessed areas, only 83.34% of the parents had reported such impairments. 
<dis>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</dis> was present in 58.33% of the patients, whereas 33.33% had <dis>nonverbal learning disabilities</dis>, 20.83% had <dis>expressive language disorder</dis>, 8.33% had borderline intellectual functioning, 4.16% had <dis>mental retardation</dis>, and only 4.16% showed <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
Conclusion
Higher brain functions are frequently impaired in paediatric patients with NF1. 
Although many parents report such disorders, they can go undetected in some cases. 
Neuropsychological assessment is recommended for all paediatric patients with NF1 to detect <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and provide early, effective rehabilitation treatment.
