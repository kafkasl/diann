Introduction
<dis>Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) occurs more frequently in first-degree relatives. 
It is believed that this risk is not specific to this disorder but also occurs with other psychopathologies. 
The study of siblings of <dis>ADHD</dis> probands is an interesting field since they share common environmental factors.
Methods
This is a narrative literature review. 
A bibliographic search was performed on PubMed and PsychNet databases and topic-related publications were included without date of publication or study design limits.
Results
Siblings of patients with <dis>ADHD</dis> have a higher likelihood of having this disorder when compared to controls, with odds ratios (OR) ranging between 11.4 and 13.5. 
Among these siblings, <dis>ADHD</dis> prevalence ranges between 26 and 45.2%. 
Siblings with <dis>ADHD</dis> and those <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>ADHD</dis></scp> have an increased risk of having other disorders, the most frequent being oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
Conclusions
Siblings of people with <dis>ADHD</dis> have an increased risk of having the same disorder. 
The risk of having another <dis>psychiatric disorder</dis> markedly increases when the sibling also presents <dis>ADHD</dis>; this is especially true for ODD, substance use disorder and bipolar disorder.
