Background and objective
<dis>Alternating hemiplegia of childhood</dis> (<dis>AHC</dis>) is a rare disease of unknown etiology characterized by early onset of recurrent episodes of <dis>hemiplegia</dis>, tonic or dystonic attacks and abnormal ocular movements with a fatal outcome to severe encephalopathy.
Our aim was to describe the clinical manifestations, precipitating factors, complementary studies results, long-term outcome and response to treatment in a series of <dis>AHC</dis> patients.
Patients and method
Descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study in 17 Spanish patients aged between 1-24 years who fulfilled diagnostic criteria of <dis>AHC</dis>.
Results
12 cases fulfilled criteria of <dis>typical AHC</dis> and 5 were atypical.
Mean age at diagnosis was 26 months.
47% cases had a family history of migraine.
Mean age at onset of hemiplegic attacks was 9.6 months.
Symptoms disappeared during sleep and precipitating factors were present in 94% cases.
Most patients developed <dis>mental retardation</dis> with <dis>ataxia</dis> and <dis>dysarthria</dis>.
Work-up tests (metabolic, neurophysiologic and radiologic) were normal or nonspecific.
In 3 patients mutations in _CACNA1A, ATP1A2_ were ruled out.
Positive responses to flunarizine was observed in 81%.
Conclusions
The characteristic clinical symptoms are still the clue to make the diagnosis of this mysterious disease, with a lack of genetic, biochemical or radiological specific studies.
Early diagnosis avoids invasive tests, repeating procedures, using ineffective and potentially toxic treatments, and allows to start treatment with flunarizine without delay.
More genetic studies are needed in broader series of patients.
