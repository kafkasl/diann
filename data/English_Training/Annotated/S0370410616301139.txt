Introduction.
Tenofovir (TDF) is an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase nucleotide analogue, although it has good tolerability and high anti-retroviral activity, its effect on the kidney has been a concern.

Objective.
To describe a girl infected with HIV who presented Fanconi syndrome during antiretroviral therapy with TDF.

Clinical case.
We describe a HIV-1-infected girl, who after 18 months treatment with TDF presented loss of strength and pain of the lower extremities with <dis>functional impairment</dis>. 
Laboratory findings were consistent with Fanconi syndrome. 
Radiographs showed bilateral hip fracture and wrists. 
Full recovery of Fanconi syndrome was achieved four months after changing antiretroviral therapy.

Conclusions.
TDF-prescribing physicians must be prepared to detect signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction and immediately consider switching to another antiviral drug.
