Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prevalence of the main geriatric syndromes among people aged more than 70 years.
To identify positive aspects of the aging process and to relate them to autonomy and self-perceived health.
Method
Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study.
Subjects.
People aged 70 years old or older attending the Gavarra Health Center (Cornellà de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain) or visited at home at least once a last year.
Sample size: 315 people, identified by systematic, randomized, stratified sampling.
Measurements: Geriatric syndromes: Urinary incontinence, polypharmacy, insomnia, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, <dis>mobility, and sensorial and emotional problems</dis>.
Instrumental and basic activities of daily living.
Self-perceived health.
Positive aspects of the ageing process: decision-making, previous satisfaction with life, feeling of usefulness, projects, and hobbies.
Information was gathered using the OMI-AP® program from June 2001 to December 2002.
Results
Of 315 individuals who were initially contacted, 283 (89%) were studied.
The main geriatric syndromes identified were: urinary incontinence (115; 41%), polypharmacy (109; 38%), and <dis>loss of vision</dis> (94; 33%).
The most important positive aspects of aging were: projects (266; 94%), decision-making (241; 85%) and feeling useful (232; 82%).
Self-perceived health was good in 164 individuals (58%) and poor in 82 (29%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of geriatric syndromes, mainly urinary incontinence, was high.
Factors associated with both instrumental and basic autonomy were the feeling of being useful, the ability to make decisions, and having projects and hobbies.
Having good self-perceived health involves other factors, which require further study.
