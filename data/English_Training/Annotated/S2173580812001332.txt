Abstract
 Introduction
The <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> are group of conditions characterised by <dis>qualitative impairments in social communication</dis>; in the interaction and imagination; with a restricted range of interests and stereotyped repetitive behaviours.
Frequently, there is a delay in the age of detection, and therefore in starting multidisciplinary evaluations and interventions, which may result in a worst prognosis and an impaired quality of life for both children and parents.
The aim of our study was to describe some clinical and epidemiological data including the age of detection and main initial complaints present in children with <dis>autism disorders</dis> from a paediatric neurology centre.
Patients and methods
A total of 393 medical records of consecutive cases with a diagnosis of <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> were reviewed.
Results
<dis>Autism</dis> was diagnosed in 82.1% of the cases, unspecified pervasive disorder in 9.9%, and Asperger syndrome in 4.8%.
Sixty percent of <dis>autistic</dis> children presented with a <dis>language disorder</dis> as their main complaint.
The average age of detection was 4 years.
Conclusions
Compared with other countries, age of detection is delayed.
A Primary Care based screening and surveillance are required in order to improve prognosis and quality of life of children with an <dis>Autism Spectrum Disorder</dis>.
