Abstract
 Traumatic brain injury is the first cause of death in persons younger than 45 years in Spain.
<dis>Swallowing disorders</dis> are common in the initial phase of a severe traumatic brain injury.
The incidence of <dis>dysphagia</dis> varies between 25 and 61% of patients and the prognosis depends on correct evaluation and early and appropriate treatment.
The outcome of <dis>dysphagia</dis> depends on a low score in the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale and the Glasgow Coma Scale, orotracheal intubation and the presence of tracheostomy.
The most widely used instrumental assessment tool for the diagnosis of <dis>dysphagia</dis> is videofluoroscopy.
This procedure consists of swallowing a variety of liquids and foods mixed with barium.
Swallowing maneuvres and oral motor exercises are useful in the rehabilitation of swallowing.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows the cortical areas that are activated during the application of rehabilitation treatment.
