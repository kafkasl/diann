Abstract
 A 45 year-old woman, right handed, with no medical history of interest, and a good level of education was seen in the clinic due to subjective complaints of memory and <dis>language problems</dis>.
She was diagnosed with <dis>primary progressive aphasia</dis> (<dis>PPA</dis>) three years ago and had received speech therapy for a year.
The psychopathological examination was normal, with <dis>categorical verbal fluency impairment</dis>, although with good comprehension and speaking ability, normal praxis and normal performance in the cognitive screening test.
The subjective complains of memory were assessed by test of verbal memory.
Furthermore, behaviour changes, particularly irritability, were reported by family.
These problems did not affect her activities of daily living.
The present case shows the difficulties in classifying cases into different subtypes of <dis>PPA</dis> and the problems in making a possible prognosis.
