Abstract
 Introduction and goals
Idiopathic sudden <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is a <dis>hearing disorder</dis> of unknown cause.
The spontaneous recovery rate ranges from 50 to 75% of the patients.
Scientific experiments on animals support the present study in patients with <dis>sudden deafness</dis> treated with sounds.
Patients and methods
During the period 2003-2009, patients with idiopathic sudden <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> were administered steroids, piracetam and antioxidants, together with the addition of sounds by means of music and words.
Results
Comparing the results of patients treated with medication (n = 65) and those treated with medication and sounds (n = 67), it was observed that patients treated with medication and sounds had higher recovery.
Within the group of patients treated with medication and sounds, 25 (37%) experienced complete recovery, 28 (42%) good recovery, 11 (16%) slight recovery and 3 (5%) poor or no recovery.
Conclusion
The patients who recovered more than half of their audition accounted for 54% in the group treated with medication and for 79% in the group of patients receiving medication and sounds.
Auditory recuperation showed no alterations, at least up to 12 months after therapy.
