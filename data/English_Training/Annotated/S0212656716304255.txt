Objective
To analyse the nutritional status of patients older than 65 years included in the home care program (PAD).
Design
Croos-sectional study.
Emplacement
3 urban health centers.
Participants
218 patients in the PAD.
Method
Mini Nutritional Assessment questionnaire (MNA) was applied. 
Sociodemographic, anthropometric, dependency, emotional and cognitive status and analytical parameters: 57 variables were collected. 
Possible associations were analysed by applying the chi square and variance analysis. 
The level of significance was considered to be P<.05 was considered.
Results
The mean age was 83.9 years (SD=7.4); 34.9% were institutionalized and 80.7% were women; 21.2% of patients were malnourished and 40.1% were at risk of it. 
A significant association was established between poorer nutritional status and older age, lower BMI, greater <dis>dependence on basic and instrumental activities of daily living</dis> and greater <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
The lowest mean hemoglobin, albumin, and iron levels were also associated with malnutrition and risk of malnutrition.
Conclusions
More than half of PAD patients are malnourished or at risk for it, and a high proportion of them some laboratory abnormality susceptible to be corrected. 
Most <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>functional dependence</dis> are closely related to malnutrition; so patients with these characteristics should receive more attention from the nutritional point of view.
