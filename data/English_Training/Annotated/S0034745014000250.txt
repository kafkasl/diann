Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Cognitive decline</dis> could begin 20 years before the diagnosis of <dis>dementia</dis>.
Besides age, several factors related to medical, socioeconomic, and behavioral and genetic condition may be associated with <dis>cognitive decline</dis>.
The aim of this systematic review was to summarize evidence on the risk and protective factors for <dis>cognitive decline</dis> in people under 65 years old.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using a search strategy in MEDLINE and Embase, including longitudinal studies to analyze the effect of protective or risk factors on <dis>cognitive decline</dis> in a population under 65 years old.
Results
A total of 22 studies were included in this review.
Factors such as diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, overweight or obesity, metabolic syndrome, education, physical activity, cognitive stimulation, marital status and diet, could be related to <dis>cognitive decline</dis> before 65 years of age.
Conclusions
Cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle conditions may be associated with <dis>cognitive decline</dis> before 65 years of age.
However, the quality of the evidence was low.
