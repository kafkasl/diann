Abstract
 Otosclerosis is a common cause of <dis>progressive hearing loss</dis> in the young adult population.
Most of the time the diagnosis is suspected based on consistent clinical symptoms and physical examination.
The role of imaging in this pathology consists of confirmation of doubtful cases, ruling out by differential diagnoses, level of affection, and the pre-postoperative evaluation of patients.
High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone is the imaging method of choice.
