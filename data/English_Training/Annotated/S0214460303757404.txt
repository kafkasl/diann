This <dis>motor speech disorder</dis> includes impairment of respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance or prosody.
A global evaluation method is necessary to assessment this complex disorder.
The few numbers of different types of test and instrumentation developed for Spanish speakers leads to a partial understanding of the disorder.
