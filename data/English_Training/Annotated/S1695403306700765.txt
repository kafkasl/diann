Background
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the most important causes of <dis>blindness</dis> in childhood.
The introduction of diode laser has represented a significant advance in its treatment.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate our results in the treatment of this entity after more than a decade of experience.
Patients and methods
One hundred eighty-two eyes in 92 premature infants with ROP treated with diode laser in the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet from 1992 to 2003 were studied.
The characteristics of the population (gestational age, birth weight, sex, stage and affected zone) and treatment outcomes were analyzed.
The change in the criteria indicating this treatment was also analyzed.
Results
In the treated population, mean gestational age (27.9 weeks) and birth weight (1015.9 g) were similar to those in other published studies.
A favorable outcome was achieved in 169 of the 182 cases (92.8 %).
The change in criteria increased the proportion of favorable outcomes to 96.1%.
Discussion
Diode laser therapy is currently the treatment of choice in ROP.
This treatment, based on guidelines for earlier intervention, provide greater efficacy without increasing morbidity.
