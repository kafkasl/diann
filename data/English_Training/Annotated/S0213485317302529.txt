Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by <dis>progressive dementia</dis> associated with <dis>global cognitive dysfunction</dis>.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating omega-3 supplementation in patients with AD.
Objective
To determine if there is scientific evidence of the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in patients with AD.
Search strategy
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central, Cinahl, and LILACS. 
An electronic search was also conducted using Google Scholar.
Study selection
Six articles met the eligibility criteria. 
The risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane method.
Conclusion
There is no consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in AD patients in the short and medium term.
