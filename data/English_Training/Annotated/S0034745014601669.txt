Abstract
 Introduction
The relationship between <dis>mental disorder</dis> and burns is complex.
<dis>Mental disorders</dis> may predispose to burns and burns can facilitate the development of <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Method
Case report and literature review.
Results
We present four cases of women with self-inflicted burns and psychotic symptoms.
The average age of these women was 39.2 years.
Burns were caused by flames in 100% of the cases and 27.2% of the total body surface was burned.
Three of the patients (75%) had a bipolar disorder with mixed symptoms and in 50 of the patients the <dis>mental illness</dis> debuted with the self-inflicted burns.
Conclusions
Basic psychopathology that may explain the occurrence of the injury and could hamper the process of recovery and rehabilitation should be explored in all burned patients.
