Abstract
 Introduction
Parkinson's Disease diagnosis is supported in clinical criteria, it is frequently observed that the progression of PD varies among different individuals.
Objective
To evaluate the clinical progression in 100 PDp with more than five years of follow up in a Movement Disorders Section.
Materials and methods
We reviewed 100 Medical records of PDp with more than five years of follow-up.
We analyzed the demographic characteristics, mean age to diagnosis, the latencies of progression to Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) I to II, HY II to III, and III to IV.
Time of onset of the hallucinations, falls, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and care needed for activities of daily living (ADL), as milestones of advanced disease.
Results
We found similar interval times between the different H&Y stages.
We observed a faster progression to <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and needed of care in ADL in patients over 50 years old at the onset of PD _(P_ <.05).
Falls were the most frequent complaint found as an advanced disease's milestone (43%).
<dis>Cognitive impairment</dis>, hallucinations and falls were associated to higher needs of care in ADL.
Conclusions
The progression of PD and the severity of parkinsonian signs and symptoms differ widely among patients.
Falls, hallucinations and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> were related to higher needs of care in ADL, suggesting they may be considered risk factors in the progression of the disease.
