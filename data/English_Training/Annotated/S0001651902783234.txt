Abstract
 Susacâ€™s syndrome is an extremely rare clinical manifestation characterized by the triad of <dis>fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, <dis>sudden visual loss</dis> and encephalopathy.
Probably subdiagnosed, it affects young women who start the clinical history with headache, <dis>visual and hearing disturbances</dis>, with neurological findings in MRI.
With unknown aetiology, pathogenesis is based on arteriolar microinfarcts in retina, cochlea, and grey and white matter in the brain.
Treatment is, as stated in the bibliography and our experience, intravenous high doses of steroids followed by oral steroids together with hyperbaric oxygen to minimize ischaemic lesions.
Aspirin associatet to nimodipin has been useful to date in the treatment of our patient.
We present a case and review the existing literature.
