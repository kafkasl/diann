Abstract
 <dis>Dementia</dis> is a syndrome characterized by <dis>acquired cognitive deficit</dis>, or behavioral syntoms that interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities.
Its prevalence increases with age, and in those aged >65 years ranges between 5-14,9%, and progressive aging of the population predicts a significant increase in it.
Globally the most common cause is Alzheimer disease.
In addition to age, several genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of developing <dis>dementia</dis>.
Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria.
The initial evaluation intends to detect <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, to determine the decline from previous levels of functioning and to rule out other entities that may present with cognitive complaints.
<dis>Dementia</dis> is usually divided into primary and secondary categories.
Ancillary tests are used to rule out the latter.
