Abstract
 Introduction
Socio-demographic and genetic factors have been involved in the development of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and its progression to <dis>dementia</dis>.
Method
The present study evaluates socio-demographic characteristics and the ApoE genotype in individuals older than 55 years with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), attending a memory clinic.
Results
155 individuals (36%) out of the total population who attended the memory clinic in a four-year period met the inclusion criteria.
The study population was classified in diagnostic groups according to the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-IV-TR) and to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NICNCDS-ADRDA) criteria.
More AD and <dis>MCI</dis> individuals worked in mainly manual occupations throughout their lifetime compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals ( _p_ =0.014).
A high percentage of individuals with <dis>MCI</dis> and of cognitively unimpaired individuals (43%) left their primary occupation or changed it for a mainly manual occupation after their retirement.
No other factors associated to the <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, including ApoE genotype, were found.
Conclusion
These results support a correlation between the primary occupation during lifetime and the development of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in individuals older than 55 years.
