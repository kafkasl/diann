Abstract
 Antipsychotic drugs are widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder due to their mood stabilizing, antimanic and antidepressant properties.
Bipolar disorder has a high rate of comorbidity with other <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, in particular anxiety disorders, substance abuse, <dis>eating disorders</dis>, <dis>personality disorders</dis> and <dis>attention deficit disorder</dis> and <dis>hyperactivity</dis>.
In this paper, a summary is provided of the various studies assessing antipsychotic efficacy when bipolar disorder presents another <dis>comorbid psychiatric disorder</dis>.
In general, these drugs have proved useful for anxiety disorders (in particular generalized anxiety disorder), alcohol consumption and <dis>borderline personality disorder</dis>.
Drugs that have been studied more commonly within this population include olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.
This work is intended as a guide for clinicians, to provide stronger evidence for the antipsychotic in question at the time of treating comorbid bipolar disorder.
