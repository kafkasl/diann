Abstract
 Introduction
A major challenge for gerontological research is to differentiate adequately between old adults with poor performance on cognitive tasks due to depression, and those who present <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> associated with <dis>dementia</dis>.
In view of the fact that cognitive plasticity has already proved to be efficient in the diagnosis of age-associated cognitive impairment, <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>, the objective of this study is to investigate the possibility that it may also prove useful in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders.
Materials and methods
A total of 50 old adults participated in the study.
These completed the Positions Test (PT) and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test of Learning Potential (AVLT-LP) as measures of cognitive plasticity.
Participants also undertook the Spanish version of Mini Mental State (MEC), Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
Socio-demographic data were also collected.
Results
With regard to cognitive plasticity, depressed old adults do not differ from those without depression.
On the other hand, old adults with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> present less cognitive plasticity than those without <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Conclusion
Cognitive plasticity appears to be a relevant variable in the differentiation between old people with low cognitive performance due to depression and old people with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
