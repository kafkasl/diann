Cogan's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disease typified by interstitial keratitis and Meniere-like auditory involvement, and it can be accompanied by systemic vasculitis. 
It's a rare disease and its diagnosis is difficult and often late, which increases the risk of sequelae, such as <dis>visual loss</dis> or <dis>deafness</dis>. 
In addition, its treatment is not well-established and is based on case reports that have observed efficacy of drugs such as cyclophosphamide, anti-TNF or tocilizumab. 
A case of Cogan's syndrome is presented that did not respond to methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or anti-TNF, but with a partial response to tocilizumab.
