Despite its high prevalence, <dis>mental disorders</dis> are often underdiagnosed.

Objective.
To determine the magnitude of the underdiagnosis <dis>mental disorders</dis> and its associated characteristics.

Methodology.
A descriptive cross-sectional study performed in Lanzarote (2011) on 310 patients selected by cluster random sampling. 
A self-completed questionnaire was used that contained the General Health Questionnaire-28, as well as structured interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to confirm the diagnosis of <dis>mental disorder</dis>. 
The current diagnosis registered in the DRAGO-AP electronic medical record was also recorded.

Results.
Of the 75 patients detected with the interview, 14 (18.67%) had a diagnosis recorded in the medical record (sensitivity=0.19; IC 95% CI; 0.09-28). 
The positive predictive value of being in the medical record was 0.56.

With respect to sensitivity, only the “number of visits made to the health centre in the last 3 months” was significantly higher in the group of patients also with a diagnosis of any <dis>mental disorder</dis> in the medical record (5 vs. 2.77; p=.002).

Conclusions.
There is an important underdiagnosis of the <dis>mental disorders</dis> in our environment. 
More visits to the health centre are associated with this diagnosis.
