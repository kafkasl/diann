Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>) is the most common <dis>chronic motor disorder</dis> in children and frequently associates sensorial pathology.
The objective of our study was to establish the prevalence and characteristics of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> in children with <dis>CP</dis>.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of patients born between the years 1975 and 2004, diagnosed of <dis>CP</dis> in the "Marqu√©s de Valdecilla" University Hospital.
Clinical data were collected including the presence of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, age at diagnosis, treatment and associated pathology.
Results
Sixty four patients had confirmed <dis>CP</dis>.
Audiological testing had been performed in thirty patients (47%) of them 18 (60%) had <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (12 bilateral and 6 unilateral).
In thirteen cases <dis>hearing loss</dis> was associated with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
The age at diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 7 years (mean 23.2 months).
Eight patients were treated with hearing aids and one with a cochlear implant.
Conclusion
<dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is frequent in <dis>CP</dis> patients.
Management of this problem is difficult in this setting because of the <dis>motor disorder</dis> and the associated pathology.
Early audiological assessment is very important to improve the language outcome in these children.
