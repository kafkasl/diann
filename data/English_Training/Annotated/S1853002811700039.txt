Abstract
 Objective
The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of family caregiver's beliefs of health status of neurological patients and its relation with the feeling of burden, as psychosocial factors of risk for their well-being, from the psychological stress model proposed by Lazarus and Folkman.
Subjects and methods
128 family caregivers were interviewed (35 were attending patients with traumatic brain injury, 38 to patients with multiple sclerosis and 55 patients with <dis>dementia</dis>), selected with not random statistical sampling strategy, of accidental type.
Cross-sectional comparative descriptive design was applied.
A caregiver socio demographic questionnaire, that includes a question about the beliefs of the patientsâ€™ health, and the Caregiver Burden Scale of Zarit and Zarit were used.
Results
The more negative caregiver's beliefs are, the more intense are their feeling of burden.
Multiple sclerosis's caregivers, who evaluate their own health as poor, when compared with other caregivers; are the ones who experience more intense feelings of burden.
They will be most likely vulnerable to stress.
Discussion
