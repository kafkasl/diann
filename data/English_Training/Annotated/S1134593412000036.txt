Abstract
 Mitochondrial cytopathies are unusual diseases of which there are more than 50 variations.
Their common pathophysiology involves a mitochondrial energy metabolism malfunction.
Muscular and brain tissue are particularly affected due to their high oxidative metabolism, hence they are usually identified as «encephalomyopathies».
Case report
A 28 year old woman, who, at the age of 20, presented with a <dis>gait disorder</dis> and drooping upper eye-lid, was diagnosed with Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
After an anxious-depressive episode, she was followed up in the Outpatients of a Mental Health Centre with psychiatric and psychological treatment.
Methods
Neuropsychological assessments were made to explore the cognitive state.
We applied the Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), the Revised Barcelona Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting.
Results
<dis>General cognitive impairment</dis> was found in all the tests administered.
<dis>Specific cognitive impairments</dis> were also found which fitted in with those found in previous studies.
Discussion
This case report emphasizes the increasing importance of neuropsychological assessment in neurological syndromes with <dis>cognitive impairments</dis> and <dis>psychiatric disturbances</dis>.
It allows us to objectify the overall level of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and to establish a correlation between the deficits and the brain areas involved.
The neuropsychological profile is very useful in future rehabilitation programs, focusing on stimulation and recovery of the affected cognitive areas.
We discussed also her relationship with mood disorders.
