Objectives
Measure the prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric syndrome (PMDS) by heteroadministered survey with diagnostic criteria of the American Association of Psychiatry (AAP) present in the DSM-IV.
Methods
An observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study was designed with location in the Basic Health Area (BHA) of Porzuna (Ciudad Real).
Scope: primary health care; rural setting.
Target population: all women between 18 and 50 years of age from the BHA (948).
A total of 226 were selected by simple random sampling, with automatic and consecutive replacement of those who refused to participate (8).
Of these, 21 could not be located or fulfilled exclusion criteria: menopause, gestation, <dis>mental retardation</dis> (11), 186 women finally participating in the study.
These women were administered a heteroadministered survey, collecting information regarding the AAP criteria for the diagnosis of PMDS during the last year and sociodemographic, comorbidity and pharmacological treatment data.
Results
A total of 84.33% of those surveyed had some type of premenstrual discomfort, these being moderate (at least one symptom during all or most of the cycles of the last year) in 69.73% and intense (5 or more symptoms in most of the cycles but without affecting work, social or family life) in 8.11% Prevalence of PMDS found according to AAP criteria is 6.49% (n = 12; 95% CI: 2.95 - 10.03%).
Conclusions
Prevalence of PMDS found in our population agrees with the data published in international studies (2.5 - 14%) and moves away from the prevalences published in our country (20.6 - 28.6%) with self-applied surveys.
