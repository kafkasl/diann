Objective
.
Analyze the mortality of the Gandhi functional zone (GFZ) to identify Public Health problems that can be improved from Primary Health Care.
Methods
.
Descriptive study of mortality during the year 1998 in a functional zone of the Health Care Area 4 in the Madrid Community (MC) with a total population of 35,636 persons.
The mortality rates have been standardized by the indirect method for large groups according to the ICD-9 and according to specific causes, taking the MC population of the year 1998 as reference.
Results
.
Globally, the GFZ presents the same mortality rate adjusted by age as the MC; however, by large groups of causes, in the GFZ, there is an overmortality in tumors (11%), digestive tract diseases (24%), <dis>mental disorders</dis> (15%) endocrine-immunological diseases (27%) and infectious diseases (60%).
In men, mortality due to COLD and lung cancer is 53% and 36% greater in the GFZ than in the MC, respectively.
In women, mortality due to diabetes is 62% greater than in the MC and due to <dis>dementia</dis> 30% greater.
Conclusions
.
The analysis of mortality in small population nuclei may contribute to detecting health problems that require the action of the Primary Health Care professionals.
For the GFZ, control of smoking in males may be the main factor to keep in mind to decrease mortality.
