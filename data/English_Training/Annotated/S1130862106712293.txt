Abstract
 Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an exfoliative skin disorder that is associated with a high mortality rate.
Its pathophysiology is similar to that of superficial burn injuries.
Treatment and optimal care of these patients are best performed in Intensive Care Burn Units, with special attention to fluid resuscitation, respiratory support, early identification of sings of sepsis, and immunosuppresive therapy with cyclosporin A.
Approach to the treatment of TEN is multidisciplinary, and there is a central and fundamental role of nursing care, particularly in the identification of signs of hypovolemia, respiratory failure, infection and pain.
Among the specific care required by these patients is the care of mucosal surfaces, to prevent serious sequelae such as <dis>blindness</dis>.
Specialized nursing care of patients with TEN contributes to an increase in the survival rate and a decrease in the incidence of complications.
