Abstract
 Introduction
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy due to the accumulation of altered prion protein isoform (PrPsc) in the brain.
The typical clinical symptoms are <dis>rapidly progressive dementia</dis>, <dis>ataxia</dis>, myoclonus, electroencephalogram (EEG) alterations, with positive 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid and changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The definitive diagnosis is done anatomopathologically.
Case report
A 64 year old female patient who presented with <dis>rapid progressive ataxia</dis>, <dis>visual disturbances</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis>, dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria and axial dystonia.
She also presented with <dis>apraxia</dis>, atrophy, myoclonus and seizures.
She died 4 months after onset, with <dis>severe motor deterioration</dis>, rigidity, flexed posture and <dis>low cognitive-behavioral impairment</dis>.
We did an anatomopathological study in addition to molecular biology.
Conclusions
We present a “defined” case study of ECJ with infrequent symptoms of <dis>ataxia</dis>, myoclonus, but <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive deterioration</dis> for its genotype</scp> (M/V1).
Despite inconclusive 14-3-3 protein levels and atypical EEG, our diagnosis was mainly guided by the rapid onset of symptoms, in which high-field MRI (with the appropriate sequences) were key in showing typical images and in defining the diagnosis.
