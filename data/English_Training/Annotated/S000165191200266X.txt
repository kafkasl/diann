Abstract
 Introduction
Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea results from an abnormal communication between the subarachnoid space and tympanomastoid compartment; most of them are of traumatic aetiology.
They have clinical interest due to the potential risk of meningitis, directly related to the aetiology.
Our aim was to show our experience in the management of this process.
Methods
A total of 17 patients diagnosed and treated for cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea from 2003 to 2011.
Results
In our study, the highest percentage of cases was spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea, with a wide clinical presentation.
The diagnosis was based on the determination of beta-2-transferrin and radiological studies, especially important for its locator value.
The treatment of choice was surgery.
Conclusions
Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea is a rare entity in otorhinolaryngological pathology.
Its diagnosis is suspected through otorrhea, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and aural fullness, while computed tomography and magnetic resonance help us to locate the defect.
Surgery is the preferred technique, and its success is based on multilayer technology with 2 or more support materials.
