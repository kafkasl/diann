Abstract
 Background
In recent years there have been changes in neurooncology that have improved quality of life and survival for patients with primary CNS tumors (PCNST).
Objectives
To present the clinical features of a cohort of patients with primary CNS glial tumors.
Materials and methods
One hundred and forty-eight patients with PCNST were followed up between 2002 and 2009.
Only glial type PCNST was studied.
This is a descriptive study.
Results
Seventy-nine patients (52 males and 27 females) presented glial type PCNST.
In most of the cases, tumors appeared in the fourth decade.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 34, GIII astrocytoma 6, GII astrocytoma 9, GI astrocytoma 5, brainstem glioma 3, chordoid glioma 1, GII oligodendroglioma 16 and GIII oligodendroglioma 5 were diagnosed according to the WHO histological tumor classification.
The frontal lobe was the most frequent location.
Initial symptomatology in order of frequency was: seizures, headache, <dis>aphasia</dis>, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, motor weakness, <dis>sensorial deficits</dis>, cranial nerve involvement and intracranial hypertension syndrome.
Surgery/radiotherapy/chemotherapy (Sx/Rt/Cht) was performed in 27 patients; Rt/Cht 20, Sx 6, Cht 6, Rt 5, Sx/Cht 5, Sx/Rt 4 and 6 patients were not treated.
Partial or complete tumor resection occurred in 51% of patients.
In 66% of the cases, the epileptic seizures (62% partials, 38% generalized) were succesfully controlled with monotherapy.
Conclusions
GBM was the most frequent tumor, and the frontal lobe was the most affected.
Seizures were the prevalent symptom.
We observed a suboptimal percentage of patients with partial or complete tumor resection.
