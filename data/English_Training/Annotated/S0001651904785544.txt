Abstract
 Objectives
To analize the results of patients with cohlear implants in postlingual adults with <dis>progressive hearing loss</dis> and to analize various predictive factors.
Material and methods
Prospective study of 42 patients with <dis>profound and progressive hearing loss</dis>.
We analized the outcomes in the first two years of follow-up.
We examined the results in regards to the of age at time of implantation, other handicaps, cause of <dis>hearing loss</dis>, age of onset, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes.
We use the logo-auditory protocol developed at the University Spanish of navarra.
Results
All tests presented a significative improvement in the first six months (p<0.01 Student t or Wilcoxon test).
After six months the results were not statistically significant.
The more important predictive factors were percentage of life with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, percentage of life with <dis>profound hearing loss</dis>, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes thus the significancy was more relevant at a follow-up period of 3 months (p<0.05 Student t or Mann- Withney test).
Conclusions
These patients showed clear benefits in a short period of time and the patients with unfavourable circumstances had a more slow progression but a similar final outcome
