Abstract
 Background
Cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor for <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, while the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is not fully understood.
The objectives were to identify a possible association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> depending on age in the Chinese rural population.
Methods
Data for the study consisted of 1782 participants (40 years and older) who lived in a rural village in the vicinity of Xi’an, China.
Data about smoking history and cognitive function were collected.
Cognitive function was scored by the Mini-Mental State Examination.
The effect of age on the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was analyzed with interaction and stratified analysis by logistic regression models.
Results
Interaction analysis showed that current smoking is positively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (odds ratio [OR] = 9.067; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.305–62.979; _P_ = 0.026).
However, the interaction term, age by current smoking, is negatively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (OR = 0.969; 95%CI 0.939–0.999; _P_ = 0.045).
Stratified logistic regression showed that in the 40–65 years of age sublayer, OR of current smoking is 1.966 ( _P_ = 0.044), whereas in the >65 years of age sublayer, the OR is 0.470 ( _P_ = 0.130).
This means that the association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> with age might be positive (OR > 1) in lower age sublayers, but no significant difference in higher age sublayers.
Conclusions
In conclusion, current smoking might be positively associated with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in the middle-aged but the relationship declines with increasing age.
