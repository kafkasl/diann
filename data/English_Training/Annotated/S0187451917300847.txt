Introduction
Based on the levels of <dis>visual disability</dis> reported by World Health Organization, has been prepared the National Campaign for Amblyopia and Strabismus in Mexico, with the Mexican Center of Strabismus, the Mexican Society of Ophthalmology, and the Mexican Council of Ophthalmology, with the objective of establishing a screening program in amblyopia in the general population.
Method
A public screening program was designed in 4 phases, from the program and organization of sites, a preparatory course, to the analysis of results, from May 2016 to January 2017.
Results
Ninety sites were organized in Mexico, 1,028 people were studied, aged 17.4±19 years, 727 were children aged 6.7±3 years. 
Several alerts were obtained that demonstrate the problematic and the requirements of public health.
Conclusions
The high levels of <dis>visual disability</dis> in the world population requires better strategies, as demonstrated by the National Campaign for Amblyopia in Mexico. 
It has to be considered a permanent information to the public, facilitating access to the first-level medical service; promoting early care of vulnerable groups; medical actualization; communication with health leaders that generates cost-effective strategies for early detection and treatment, controlled by laws that results in the reduction of <dis>visual disability</dis>. 
Fourteen Iberomerican countries joined the campaign because finally the causes of amblyopia are the same, the lack of information is repeated, and the numbers of disability increase.
