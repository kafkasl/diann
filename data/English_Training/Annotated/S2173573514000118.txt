Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic immune-mediated vasculitis of unknown origin characterised by recurrent orogenital ulceration, ocular inflammation and skin lesions.
The aim of our study was to identify ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations associated with BD.
Patients and methods
Retrospective review of the medical records of all patients diagnosed with BD who attended a tertiary public hospital in Cantabria (Spain) over a period of 22 years.
Clinical manifestations, in particular those concerning ENT, were retrieved from medical records.
A medical literature review of ENT manifestations was conducted.
Results
Thirty-three patients (age range: 17–64 years) were included in the study.
Most of them presented oral ulcers (97%).
Eight patients (24%) presented oropharyngeal ulcers and 5 patients (15%) experienced audiovestibular symptoms (high frequency <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, vertigo and bilateral vestibular hypofunction).
One patient had symptoms compatible with vestibular neuronitis as the presentation manifestation of Neuro-Behçet.
In 4 patients (12%) the presence of odynophagia secondary to the presence of oropharyngeal lesions, initially interpreted as acute or recurrent tonsillitis, was the first manifestation of the disease, alone or associated with cutaneous or ocular lesions.
Conclusions
In addition to the characteristic oral ulcers present in most patients with BD, ulcers in the oropharynx, occasionally interpreted as acute pharyngitis, are also common in these patients.
Audiovestibular manifestations frequently appear during the course of the disease and may be the first symptom of central nervous system involvement.
