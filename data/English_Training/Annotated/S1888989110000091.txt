Abstract
 Introduction
We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with <dis>mental retardation</dis> and dysmorphic features referred to child psychiatry because of altered behavior at school.
Material and methods
Karyotyping (GTG banding), _in situ_ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) and molecular study of parental origin by polymorphic STS were performed.
Results
Genetic study revealed a 48,XXXX karyotype with a maternal origin of the X-tetrasomy.
The mechanism was successive non-dysjunction at meiosis I and II.
Conclusions
The interest of this case lies in the rarity of the chromosomal anomaly and its late diagnosis, leading to a failure to adapt the girl's education to her needs, with consequences for her psyche.
