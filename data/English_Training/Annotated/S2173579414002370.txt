Abstract
 Case report
A case is presented of a 30-year-old male with ichthyosis, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, epilepsy and spasticity.
Ocular examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 0.5 and bilateral crystalline maculopathy.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal hyperreflective spots and intrafoveal microcystoid spaces.
The diagnosis of Sjögren–Larsson syndrome (SLS) was made, and confirmed by genetic analysis.
Discussion
SLS is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene.
A previously unreported novel mutation was identified, c. 681–14T > G. Macular OCT makes it possible to find even funduscopy invisible changes.
Its use is important because the OCT features of SLS are specific and, therefore, it can help to diagnose this rare systemic disease.
