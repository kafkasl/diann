An ischaemic infarction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) is usually associated with vertigo, <dis>hearing loss</dis>, <dis>facial palsy</dis>, nystagmus, or <dis>truncal ataxia</dis>; it is often accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs.
<dis>Suddenonset bilateral hearing loss</dis> without associated neurological symptoms is infrequent in the literature.
We report a case of <dis>sudden bilateral hearing loss</dis>, later diagnosed as AICA infarction without other symptoms.
