Abstract
 Background
Ageing has been linked to a high prevalence of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, which, in turn, has been related to balance disturbances and <dis>gait disorders</dis>.
The aim of this study was to identify whether there are differences between subjects with and without <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> regarding the quality of gait and balance.
Material and methods
An observational study was conducted on institutionalised people older than 65 years (n = 82).
Gait and balance was evaluated after the assessment of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Single and dual tests were used including, the 6-minute walking, stride length, and gait speed.
Timed Up and Go tests were also used to evaluate balance.
Results
The participants were divided into three groups: 28 subjects in the group <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> (MMSE ≥ 27), 29 subjects with mild (27 < MMSE ≤ 21) and 26 subjects with <dis>moderate cognitive impairment</dis> (MMSE < 21).
Gait assessment showed significant between-groups differences in all the variables ( _P_ < .05).
The variables assessing balance also showed significantly worse values in those groups with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Conclusion
The severity of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is related to <dis>impaired balance and gait</dis>, thus the clinical monitoring of these variables in population at risk is needed.
