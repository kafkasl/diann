Introduction
Dementia units (DU) provide comprehensive and specialised care to patients with <dis>dementia</dis>. 
However, assessment in these units normally focuses on patient management. 
The aim of this study was to determine satisfaction of the caregivers of patients managed in a DU and how they rated DU care.
Methods
We created a self-administered questionnaire which was completed by 236 caregivers visiting the DU in 2015. 
The questionnaire included 6 dimensions (accessibility, organisation, professionalism, relationship with staff, information, and facilities); data were analysed using problem rates.
Results
A total of 53.4% caregivers completed the questionnaire; most were women, patients’ spouses, or first-degree relatives. 
The overall problem rates was 15.0% (95% CI, 13.9-16.1), with sizeable differences between dimensions: from 0.1% (95% CI, 0.0-0.4) for ‘relationship with staff’ and ‘professionalism’ to 49.3% (95% CI, 45.4-53.2) for ‘information’. 
Waiting times over 30minutes were perceived as excessive. 
Information problems were not directly related to patient management. 
Satisfaction was scored 8.29/10 (median 8; SD 1.45); 77.3% (95% CI, 69.8-74.8) of respondents were highly satisfied. 
Ninety-nine percent of the caregivers stated that they would recommend the DU.
Conclusions
This questionnaire provides interesting data on care quality as perceived by patients’ caregivers. 
Our results have allowed us to identify problems and implement corrective actions. 
Our questionnaire has proved to be a useful tool for evaluating and improving care quality in DUs.
