Donostia Longitudinal Study has investigated the effect of non-pharmacological interventions in older adults <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> and with <dis>dementia</dis>.
The current work is derived from this study and aims to go in depth into the linguistic profile of participants, as well as to perform a first empirical approximation to the effect of multi-type intervention in linguistic constructs.
We have had a sample of 395 subjects divided between stages from 1 to 4 of the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).
There have been three groups for each stage: one of them followed an intervention established according to a pattern of decline by stages; the second performed stimulation tasks without any theoretical background and the third did not receive any kind of intervention.
The results showed a better performance in participants with GDS 1 and 2 compared to those with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Between GDS 3 and 4, differences were found in vocabulary, writing and semantic fluency, but not in listening comprehension, reading comprehension and phonological fluency.
Regarding to the effect of the intervention, an improvement is observed for those variables that measure lexical-phonological processes in those participants who do <scp><neg>not</neg> suffer <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
