The features of Wernicke's encephalopathy have been described as a combination of confusion, ocular abnormalities, and <dis>ataxia</dis>. 
Encephalopathy can complicate hyperemesis gravidarum because it impairs correct absorption of an adequate amount of thiamine and can cause electrolyte imbalance. 
We present the case of a 22-year-old primipara who was admitted to hospital due to lethargy, generalized weakness, ophthalmoplegia, <dis>language disturbance</dis>, and weight loss in her 12th week of pregnancy. 
The patient had a history of hyperemesis gravidarum three weeks before admission. 
Physical examination revealed a lethargic patient with horizontal nystagmus, <dis>ataxia</dis>, and symmetric hyporeflexia. 
Parenteral thiamine therapy was started. 
The patient recovered from the neurological deficits after 6 weeks of treatment.
