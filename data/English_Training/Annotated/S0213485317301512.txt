Objectives
To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients with epilepsy from a reference centre in Colombia.
Methods
Cross-sectional study including patients diagnosed with epilepsy who attended our epilepsy centre (Neurocentro) between 2013 and 2016. 
Data were gathered from patientsâ€™ medical histories.
Results
We gathered data from a total of 354 patients diagnosed with epilepsy. 
Median age was 37 years; 52% were men. 
Seizures were focal in 57% of the patients and generalised in 38%; seizure type was not determined in 6% of the sample. 
The most frequent aetiology was cryptogenic (21%), followed by traumatic (14%). 
Median time of disease progression and age at onset were 23 and 11 years, respectively. 
Psychiatric comorbidities were found in 18% of the patients and 40% had some degree of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
Around 40% of our sample reported adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs at some point during treatment. 
Antiepileptic drugs were administered in monotherapy in 36% of the patients. 
Around 37% had drug-resistant epilepsy and 14% underwent surgery.
Conclusions
Psychiatric comorbidities, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, adverse drug reactions, and drug-resistant epilepsy are common among epileptic patients in Colombia. 
Knowledge of the factors with an impact on epilepsy may lay the foundations for improving management of these patients on the administrative level and improving quality of life.
