Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prospective validity of Test Your Memory (TYM) and its sensitivity to change in cognitive state.
Methods
This longitudinal prospective study followed 71 patients with subjective cognitive symptoms and 48 with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> for a mean time period of 35.2 ± 15 months.
Subjects did <scp><neg>not</neg> have <dis>dementia</dis> or depression at the beginning of follow-up</scp> and each participant was given the TYM at least two times.
A psychometric threshold was established to determine presence of a <dis>cognitive deficit</dis> (z-score ≤ 1.5 on at least one cognitive domain) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia scale was used to ensure full functional ability.
The criterion for deterioration was a change in the stage on the Global Deterioration Scale.
Results
Sixty-one patients remained cognitively stable and 58 worsened.
There were no differences between them with respect to sex, educational attainment, the initial stage on the GDS, or the score on the first TYM.
Subjects who worsened were older than those who did not.
The TYM increased an average of 0.04 points per month in patients who remained stable or improved (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.08) and decreased an average of 0.14 points per month in those whose condition worsened (95% CI, -0.19 to -0.09).
Subjects with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> who worsened displayed a sharper loss of TYM points than did subjects with subjective cognitive symptoms.
Conclusions
While the TYM lacks prospective validity, it is sensitive to changes in cognitive state.
