Abstract
 Introduction
Researching <dis>inherited mental retardation</dis>, from a diagnostic and aetiological point of view, is a great challenge.
A particular type of <dis>mental retardation</dis> is the one linked to the X chromosome which is classified under syndromic and non-syndromic types, according to the presence or absence of a specific physical, neurological or metabolic pattern associated with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Patients and method
Five generations of a family have been studied with eight males suffering from <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Six of these males were clinically tested using anthropometric indicators and genetic tests: high resolution karyotypes, fragile X research, linkage and MID1 and PQBP1 gene studies.
Results
Along with <dis>mental retardation</dis> _,_ the clinical study showed a pattern of microcephaly, micrognathia, osteoarticular and genital anomalies, short stature and other less frequent malformations.
The linkage study mapped the possible causal gene of this <dis>mental retardation syndrome</dis> and multiple congenital abnormalities in the Xp11.23-q21.32 segment, with a LOD score of 2.
As far as we know, a medical profile, similar to the one these patients have, linked to this X segment has not been described.
Conclusions
We suspect that this family has a “new syndrome” of <dis>mental retardation</dis> and multiple congenital anomalies linked to the X chromosome.
