Introduction
Medically unexplained symptoms are defined as physical symptoms that have been present for several weeks and that an adequate medical evaluation has not revealed any disease that explains them; when these symptoms become persistent, they lead to comprehensive clinical investigations and multiple interventions. 
These patients have a greater or at least comparable commitment to physical functioning, mental health, and negative health perception than patients with multiple chronic medical conditions; have significantly more stressful life events (psychological, physical and/or sexual abuse) and are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression.
Objective
To characterize sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics of a group of patients identified in primary care with medically unexplained symptoms.
Methodology
A descriptive, cross-sectional study with patients from 18 to 70 years old who were given PHQ-15, PHQ-9 and PHQ for anxiety, and a survey designed for the study.
Results
36 patients were analysed, 94.4% women, median age 45 [RIC, 20] years-old, 33.3% married, 91.7% had children. 
55% had severe functional somatic symptoms, 77.8% had one or more <dis>functional somatic disorders</dis>, and 77.7% had clinically relevant affective or anxiety symptoms. 
25% of the patients reported a history of child abuse, 41.7% were mistreated by a partner, and 41.6% were victims of the Colombian armed conflict.
Conclusions
The main finding of this study was that 8 out of 10 patients met criteria for a <dis>functional somatic disorder with great symptomatic severity</dis> and three out of ten patients met criteria for two <dis>functional disorders</dis>, most of these patients without other basic medical diseases. 
In addition, we found a high prevalence of exposure to different types of violence that these patients have been subjected to throughout their life.
