Amyloidosis is a term that involves a group of diseases characterised by deposition of extracellular monoclonal light-chain fibrillar immunoglobulin aggregates in the body, including many organs, with the larynx among them.

A case is presented of a 78 year-old man who was referred to our institution for strangulated umbilical hernia treatment. 
He suffered from progressive hoarseness and <dis>dysphagia</dis> for 5months. 
He had a history of primary laryngeal amyloidosis. 
Awake intubation was performed successful with the King VisionÂ® video-laryngoscopy. 
Sedation was achieved using a remifentanil infusion and midazolam. 
Haemorrhagic lesions are caused by deposition of amyloid in and around vessels, resulting in increased vascular fragility. 
Therefore, anaesthetists should take care in intubating the tracheas of these patients.
