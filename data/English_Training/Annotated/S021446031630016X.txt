Abstract
 <dis>Hearing loss</dis> is a significant problem for the elderly: It is the third most important chronic problem after hypertension and arthritis during ageing.
Screenings such as the hearing-dependent daily activities Scale –HDDA– were designed to be applied in non-hospital settings in order to detect possible hearing problems that have to be ratified through a complete audiological examination.
The aim of this paper is to present the results of a research study to test the effectiveness of the HDDA Scale as a tool for detecting <dis>hearing loss</dis> in a sample of 135 elderly people, considering that some of these people had <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was explored using pure-tone audiometry and the HDDA Scale, as well as the presence of <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> by Pfeiffer's questionnaire.
We conclude by showing that the HDDA Scale can be a useful tool to identify individuals with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, especially when their <dis>hearing loss</dis> is greater than 40 dB.
However, it is important to note that, in the case of people with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>, we observed that their answers to the questionnaire are less reliable and tend to underestimate the potential problems posed by <dis>hearing loss</dis> in their everyday life.
