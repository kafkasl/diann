Objective
To describe how relatives of patients admitted to nursing homes qualify death and determine which factors influence this qualification.
Method
A descriptive and retrospective study. 
A questionnaire was sent to 52 relatives of deceased patients of 8 nursing homes. 
The Good Death Inventory (GDI) and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were used to assess different aspects of patient death; in addition open questions on aspects of end of life decisions were included. 
Non-parametric tests were performed to check for differences between the qualification of sociodemographic and clinical variables, physical symptoms, decision making and quality of end of life.
Results
34 relatives 34 families responded to the questionnaire. 
67.6% women with an average age of 57.03 years (SD=12.35). 
Most of the deceased patients were women (61.8%) with a mean age of 86 years (SD=7,23). 
The most severe symptom in the last days of life was depression (m=7.75, SD=2.44). 
Being respected as an individual“was the dimension that scored best (m=6.01; SD=1.56), and”Independence“worst (m=1.72; SD=1.28). 
Relatives of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> reported a lower percentage of a good death (23.1% vs. 61.1%, P=.00) than the rest. 
The dimensions”physical and psychological comfort“(P=.00),”Show Hope and pleasure“(P=.03) and”Feeling that their life is worth living“(P=.01) scored higher in cases which reported a good death.
Discussion
Almost half of the relatives of patients who died in nursing homes reported a good quality of death. 
Aspects such as human respect and intimacy were highly rated. 
<dis>Dementia</dis> is a factor that might be considered in further studies.
