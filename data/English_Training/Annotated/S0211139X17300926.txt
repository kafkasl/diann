Abstract
 Introduction
The Edmonton Frailty Scale was developed in Alberta (Canada).
It has been applied in different scenarios, such as acute units, day hospitals, and outpatient care.
There are no studies published describing the usefulness of this scale in Colombia.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study and secondary diagnostic test analysis was designed with the objective of studying the criterion validity of the Edmonton Frail Scale using Fried's frailty criteria as standard.
Patients 60 years old and over from the community were included.
Patients with <dis>severe dementia</dis>, <dis>limited mobility</dis>, and unable to perform the tests were excluded.
Results
The study included 101 patients from the community in Floridablanca, Colombia.
The mean age was 68.9 years, and 74% were women.
The median walking speed was 1.1 m/sec.
According to the Fried's criteria, 46% were vigorous elderly, and the prevalence of frailty was 7.9%.
Using the EFS, 78% were vigorous elderly, with a prevalence of frailty of 8.9%.
Taking 6 or more points as a cut-off, the sensitivity of this scale was 75% and had a specificity of 88%.
Conclusions
A similar frequency of frailty was found on applying the two measurement scales.
It is important to highlight the multidimensional view of the Edmonton scale, complementing the data of the most physical and sarcopenia-centred phenotype of Fried's criteria.
