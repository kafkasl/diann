Abstract
 <dis>Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) is a common neuro-behavioural disorder with onset in childhood.
These children have impaired emotional self- control, self-regulation of drive and motivation.
Numerous studies have reported <dis>cognitive disabilities in memory, executive functions, spatial abilities and language skills</dis>.
The main objective of this work is to determine whether a socio-emotional intervention programme could improve executive functions in children with <dis>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</dis>.
The sample of this study consisted of 25 children (8 female and 17 male) aged between 8 and 12 years, diagnosed with <dis>ADHD</dis> and who were not taking any psychopharmacological treatment at the time of the study, and had not taken medication previously.
Executive functioning was assessed through the Zoo Map test and Tower of Hanoi puzzle in pre-/post-test design.
A socio-emotional intervention programme was implemented.
The training consisted of 8 one-hour weekly sessions, on an individual basis.
Results indicate that such a programme does lead to improved performance in the execution of tasks that evaluate executive functions.
After the intervention, the children took less time to resolve the Zoo Map test.
Results for the Hanoi Tower puzzle were also improved after intervention.
The children needed a lower number of movements to complete the task.
