Human behaviours have different meanings according to the historical moment and context. 
In this article sexual behaviours are taken as a category in order to analyse how psychiatric nosology is structured, as manifested in texts such as the DSM-5. 
The development of these diagnostic manuals are tools that are far from being free of subjectivities and interference of elements of power, expressed in the way health, illness, mental health, and <dis>mental disorders</dis>, are assumed; in short, the normal and pathological.
Each new diagnosis, or even its elimination, and the recomposing of the different diagnostic criteria, especially in the field of sexual behaviour, present visions of how individual and collective human life is conceived, as well as an expression of accurate attempts to control human sexualities through the medicalisation of behaviour, coupled with moral, religious, and even legal considerations.
Categories such as gender dysphoria, paraphilia or paraphilic disorders are examples of how the limits intended to establish a biomedical perspective are also incomplete and imprecise. 
These violate individual and social construction of sexualities and the conception of mental health, showing persistent difficulties and controversies that are evident in the way psychiatric classifications are made.
