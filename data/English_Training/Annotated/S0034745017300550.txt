Objectives.
The present research aims to describe the knowledge of elementary school teachers about <dis>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) through interviews about general information, symptoms/diagnosis and treatment, in addition to perceived self-efficacy.

Methods.
A descriptive cross-sectional population study was carried out, involving 62 teachers from public schools in the municipality of Sabaneta. 
The teachers were evaluated by the Spanish adaptation of the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (KADDS), an estimation scale composed of 36 items of three alternative answers (true, false and I do not know).

Results.
Teachers correctly answered a little less than half of the items in the total questionnaire (48.52%). 
Specifically, it was in the subscale of dymptoms/diagnosis in which they presented more hits with 69.35%, followed by the treatment subscale (45.30%), and finally the general information (38.60%).

Conclusions.
According to the data obtained, the need for interventions on the subject is confirmed, so that this is reflected in new teaching techniques that facilitate the learning and development of children with the disorder.
