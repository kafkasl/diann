Abstract
 The audiology is a discipline that since its inception has sought in technology resources to address <dis>communication problems</dis> resulting from <dis>hearing disorders</dis>.
Among the different possibilities that enhance auditory perception, cochlear implants are an important milestone as it is indicated in the <dis>bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss</dis> involving major problem for human communication.
Currently, the widespread use of cochlear implants can raise new perspectives in the study of <dis>hearing and communication disorders</dis> associated with this loss.
The voice is one of the aspects of communication that are most altered in relation to the degree of <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Although there are many studies that relate speech and hearing, yet little literature studying this relationship in adult patients with cochlear implants.
The aim of this paper is to raise this ratio in patients with <dis>post-lingual profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> that after undergoing cochlear implant surgery are able to reflect through a subjective assessment by the Voice Handicap Index an evolution in the perception of their own voice.
The results regarding the perception of voice before and after cochlear implant by study subjects correlated with the publications to date and reflect a subjective improvement in this perception.
