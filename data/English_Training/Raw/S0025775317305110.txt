Abstract
 Anaemia is common in the elderly and is associated with an increased risk of physical, functional, and cognitive impairment, hospitalisation and mortality.
Although it is unknown whether anaemia is a causal factor or a subrogated marker of worse health status, its correction can improve the patientsâ€™ physical and functional capacity.
Detection, classification, and treatment of anaemia should be a priority for the health system.
The main causes of anaemia in the elderly are nutritional deficiencies and chronic disease, with or without kidney failure, although some cases are of indeterminate origin.
Medical history and physical examination help to clarify its aetiology.
A diagnostic algorithm based on data from the lab allows anaemia classification with a therapeutic orientation.
Supplements of iron and maturation factors, as well as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, constitute the mainstay of treatment, along with that of the underlying disease, whereas red blood cell transfusion should be reserved for severe cases.
