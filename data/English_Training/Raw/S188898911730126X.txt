Background
Little is published about the impact of the 2008 economic crisis on mental health services in Spain.
Method
An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to investigate a potential short-term association between the 2008 economic crisis and the number of psychiatric hospital admissions. 
The timing of the intervention (April 2008) was based on observed changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
Data on 1,152,880 psychiatric inpatients from the national Hospital Morbidity Survey, 69 months before and after the onset of the economic crisis (April 2008), were analyzed.
Results
Age-adjusted psychiatric (ICD9 290-319) hospital discharge rates significantly increased from April 2008, matching the onset of the crisis, especially for inpatients aged 15-24 years old and to a less extend for inpatients aged 25-34 years old. 
Other age groups were not affected. 
There was a significant increase in diagnoses for disturbance of conduct and emotions, depression, neurotic and personality disorders and alcohol and drug disorders; however, diagnoses for mental retardation and organic psychosis for 15-34 years old inpatients were unaffected.
Conclusions
Psychiatric hospital admissions abruptly increased in April 2008, coinciding with the onset of the economic crisis. 
We identified age groups and diagnoses affected. 
Increased hospitalizations were found only at the age-ranges most affected by the rise in unemployment. 
The diagnoses affected were those most sensitive to environmental changes.
