Abstract
 This is a case report of a papillary thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the parapharyngeal space, that presented with local obstructive symptoms (dysphagia and displacement of the ipsilateral tonsil).
The diagnosis was suspected by imaging studies (CT and MRI) but not confirmed until histological examination.
It is not common for such tumors to metastasize to the parapharyngeal space.
This is the reason why, to our knowledge, there have been described only five similar cases previously.
