Abstract
 Background and objectives
Residual hearing is considered a prognostic factor in patients with cochlear implants.
Objective determination of residual hearing by steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) is of the utmost importance.
The aims of this study were to quantify residual hearing and evaluate the usefulness of SSEP measurement in patients with cochlear implants.
Methods
Liminal pure-tone audiometry was applied in 12 patients before and after cochlear implantation.
SSEP were evaluated post-implantation.
Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations were carried out and contingency tables were constructed.
Results
Residual hearing at a frequency of 125 Hz was preserved in 37.5% of the patients, at 250 and 500 Hz in 45.45%, and at 1000 Hz in 27.27%.
After implantation, residual hearing at 2000 Hz was retained in 28.85%, at 4000 Hz in 16%, and at 8000 Hz in 0%.
Post-implantation SSEP showed no response in the implanted ear as compared with the non-implanted ear at frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz.
Because the patients had bilateral profound hearing loss, this finding suggested partial destruction of the neural tissue in the implanted ear.
Conclusions
Residual low frequency hearing was preserved in most patients.
Our results suggest that SSEP is useful in the assessment of residual hearing.
