Abstract
 Isolated congenital hypoaldosteronism is a rare disorder that presents as chronic salt-wasting syndrome during infancy.
Aldosterone synthase deficiency due to mutations in _CYP11B2_ is the underlying cause in most cases.
Apart from the classical electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), no other extra-adrenal features have been described to date.
We report a male child with congenital hypoaldosteronism due to a homozygous missense mutation (Thr318Met) in _CYP11B2_ who also presented with unexplained sensorineural hearing loss.
