Abstract
 To assess the functional hearing ability of a small child with hearing loss, it is necessary to resort to different indirect tests that can reflect the information being provided by hearing aids, or by exploring what the child is doing with this acoustic information, mainly as regards the abilities in the acquisition and development of language.
From the results of this assessment, it can be determined if the adjustment is the best that this child can achieve at that time, or if modifications need to be made to optimise it and thus achieve the best intelligibility of speech in a variety of communication environments and situations.
