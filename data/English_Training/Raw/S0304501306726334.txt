Abstract
 Iodine deficiency is currently the most preventable cause of brain damage and mental retardation in both the fetus and neonate and of psychomotor impairment in young children.
According to the WHO and UNICEF, iodine deficiency affects some 2000 million people worldwide, representing onethird of the world population.
Limited consumption during pregnancy can also lead to lasting problems with maternal thyroid function after pregnancy.
The easiest and cheapest measure with the best results in preventing iodine deficiency is iodine prophylaxis using iodized salt.
To achieve this, an appropriate health policy is required that keeps the general population and, in particular, women of fertile age informed.
It is here that midwives, in their role as health advocates, acquire particular importance, as they are the health professionals most suited to impart health education in pregnancy.
