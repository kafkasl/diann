Abstract
 Antipsychotic drugs are widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder due to their mood stabilizing, antimanic and antidepressant properties.
Bipolar disorder has a high rate of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, in particular anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, personality disorders and attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity.
In this paper, a summary is provided of the various studies assessing antipsychotic efficacy when bipolar disorder presents another comorbid psychiatric disorder.
In general, these drugs have proved useful for anxiety disorders (in particular generalized anxiety disorder), alcohol consumption and borderline personality disorder.
Drugs that have been studied more commonly within this population include olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.
This work is intended as a guide for clinicians, to provide stronger evidence for the antipsychotic in question at the time of treating comorbid bipolar disorder.
