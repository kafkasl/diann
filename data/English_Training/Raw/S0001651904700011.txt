Abstract
 Objective
To know the etiology of preiperlingual bilateral hearing loss in children.
Materials and methods
All the patients diagnosed with bilateral severe/profound, pre or perilingual hearing loss at Sierrallana and Marqu√©s de Valdecilla Hospitals (Cantabria, Spain) during the last 20 years were included in this study.
Results
A hundred patients were diagnosed with bilateral severe/profound pre/perilingual hearing loss.
The most frequent etiology was hereditary (49%), followed by severe perinatal hypoxia (11%), ototoxicity (5%), meningitis (3%), hyperbilirubinemia (3%) and rubella (2%).
In 21% of cases was not Known.
Conclusions
The two most frequent etiologies found in severe/profound hearing loss in children in our area were hereditary and non infectious perinatal problems.
Infectious disease were scarce.
Will decrease when genetic test were used as clinical basis.
