Sudden deafness owing to labyrinth hemorrhage is a relatively rare clinical entity; labyrinth hemorrhage may be the only demonstrable finding in neuroimaging studies performed for sudden deafness, whether as an isolated finding or associated with labyrinthitis, manifesting as labyrinth hyperintensity in T1-weighted MRI sequences without enhancement after contrast administration.
We present a case in which cochlear hemorrhage caused sudden deafness in a previously asymptomatic 22-year-old woman.
We review the literature and evaluate the role of the presence of hyperintensity in cranial MRI.
