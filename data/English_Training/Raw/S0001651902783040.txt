Abstract
 Diabetes mellitus is considered a risk factor for sensorineural sudden deafness.
Its pathogenesis remains unknown.
However, the physiopathological implication of a hyperviscosity syndrom in diabetics and patients bearing of sudden deafness can mean the nexus between the two entities.
Total blood viscosity and erythrocyte adhesion were haemorheological parameters significatively higher in blood of diabetics with sudden deafness than in normal hearing controls.
Moreover, erythrocyte filterability and deformability were lower in diabetics, but it was not statistically significative.
These findings help to guide therapy in these patients towards specific measures to improve blood viscoelastic properties.
