Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
To assess the improvement of quality of life in osseointegrated implanted patients, taking into account the indication as well as the use of the implant, and the presence of pre- and postoperative tinnitus.
Methods
Sixty-nine patients implanted between June 2004 and November 2010 were included.
The average age of the patients was 40 years.
The instruments used to quantify the change in quality of life were the Glasgow Benefit Inventory and a questionnaire including open questions, bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) use, change in tinnitus and postoperative pain.
Results
The average total benefit score with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory was 38, and the general, social, and physical scores were 51, 15 and 7, respectively.
There was no significant association between sex, age and bilaterality or unilaterality of the process with quality of life.
Nevertheless, there were significantly better results in patients with conductive hearing loss than in those with unilateral deafness, and the results were positive although in both groups.
The tinnitus rate went from 37.5 to 20.8% following BAHA, with this difference being significant.
Conclusions
Our results show that the use of BAHA is associated with a great improvement in quality of life for patients with conductive hearing loss, whereas indications in unilateral deafness have to be individually studied.
Moreover, the study shows that BAHA has a positive effect upon tinnitus.
