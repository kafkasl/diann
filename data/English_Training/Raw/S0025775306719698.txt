Background and objective
The ESEMeD-Spain project is an epidemiological study about mental disorders in Spain.
We present 12 month-prevalence and lifetime-prevalence of the main mood, anxiety and alcohol use disorders; the influence of sociodemographic factors on its presence and age of onset of the disorders.
Subjects and method
Cross-sectional household survey of a representative sample of the population of Spain 18 years or older.
Sample size was 5.473 individuals.
The WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMHCIDI) was used.
Response rate was 78.6%.
Results have been weighted to represent the population of Spain.
Results
19.5% of the individuals presented a mental disorder sometime in their lifetime (lifetime- prevalence) and 8.4% in the last 12 months (12 month- prevalence).
The most frequent mental disorder was major depressive episode, with a 12-month prevalence of 3.9% and a lifetime- prevalence of 10.5%.
The other most lifetime prevalent disorders were specific phobia, alcohol abuse disorder, and disthymia.
Factors associated to presenting a mental disorder were being female, being separated, divorced or widowed, and being unemployed, on sick leave or incapacitated.
Social phobia, agoraphobia and specific phobia appear at younger ages, while mood disorders and panic disorder appears later in life.
Conclusions
The ESEMeD-Spain study can provide careful outcomes to understand the impact of mental disorders in Spain.
