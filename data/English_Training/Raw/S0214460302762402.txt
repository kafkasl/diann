Abstract
 The aim of this paper is to examine wheter preschool children with moderate Specific Language Impairment (SLI) exhibit impaired phonological representations in a task of serial recall of groups of nonsense and familiar words.
Results support explanations of SLI that attribute the disorder to problems in working memory particularly impairments in phonological representations.
Specifically, children with SLI performed more poorly than children without SLI when processing of nonsense words and familiar words in initial position.
No such differences were observed between the groups when the task involved processing nonsense and familiar words in final position.
The above findings suggest that children with SLI devote more cognitive resources to the processing of items in final position because of capacity limitations in phonological working memory.
Theoretical and practical implications are discussed
