Abstract
Several articles show the audiologic benefits of cochlear implants, although it is still necessary to prove their impact on quality of life.
In this study, 36 Med-El processor users were included.
The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) was used to measure changes in quality of life, and another questionnaire was used to evaluate the communication abilities.
Eighty-six percent of the patients answered our questionnaire.
The quality of life improved significantly according to the specific questionnaire.
The average total benefit obtained with the GBI was +41, and the average scores related to general, social and physics benefits were +57, +16, and +3, respectively.
No significant difference was found between quality of life and other parameters like insertion depth of the array, etiology or duration of the deafness.
