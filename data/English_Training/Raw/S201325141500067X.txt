Abstract
 Cognitive impairment is defined as a newly appeared deficit in at least two areas of cognitive functions, including disturbances in memory, executive functioning, attention or speed of information processing, perceptual motor abilities, or language.
Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in ESRD patients when compared with the general population.
It has also been associated with a decreased quality of life.
Cognitive functions in patients with ESRD showed improvement with dialysis and renal transplantation.
These findings illustrate the potential importance of evaluating and comparing the effects of hemodialysis and transplantation regarding cognitive performance and thus quality of life in ESRD patients and normal subjects.
This study was carried out in 100 patients (50 ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis for at least 6 months and 50 post-transplant patients who had maintained successful kidney graft for at least 3 months).
All patients underwent laboratory and psychometric scoring tests, including trail making test part A, trail making test part B, digit span, and mini-mental state examination.
Thirty healthy adults matched by age and sex served as a control group.
The results showed significant differences in cognitive function tests results between transplant and hemodialysis patients ( _P_ < 0.01), suggesting that transplant patients were superior in their cognitive performance, with the correction of anemia being the most important factor for improving cognitive performance in both groups.
There were no significant differences between transplant patients and control subjects in psychometric measures ( _P_ > 0.05).
Conclusion
Renal transplantation as a modality of treatment, in ESRD patients, is superior to hemodialysis in terms of cognitive performance improvement.
