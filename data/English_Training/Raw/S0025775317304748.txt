Background and objective.
Dual diagnosis is the coexistence of an addictive disorder and another mental disorder. 
The objective is to estimate cravings and self-reported quality of life in a sample of patients with alcoholic dependence, with or without dual pathology, who attend an outpatient treatment centre.

Patients and method.
A cross-sectional study of 112 patients (56 dual and 56 non-dual), diagnosed with alcohol dependence according to DSM-IV-TR. 
The presence of cravings is determined by the Multidimensional Alcohol Craving Scale and quality of life through the SF-36 Health Questionnaire.

Results.
There are no statistically significant differences in cravings in either subgroup; the latter tend to refer to lower alcohol cravings than non-dual patients. 
The dual patients have a worse quality of life in all categories evaluated, highlighting a worse quality of life in the categories: social function, emotional role, vitality and general health. 
Females present a lower quality of life emphasising those of social function and emotional role. 
No differences were detected in relation to cravings between the 2 groups.

Conclusions.
In order to perform a correct clinical and therapeutic approach for patients with alcohol dependence, we should consider focusing on the evaluation of cravings and quality of life. 
In order to perform a correct clinical and therapeutic approach for patients with alcohol dependence, it is necessary to consider cravings and quality of life, since these parameters are important for the evaluation of patients with alcohol dependence.
