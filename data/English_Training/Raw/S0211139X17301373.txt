Introduction.
The prevalence of pelvic fracture (PF) due to frailty is increasing, leading to an increase in functional impairment in the patient, as well as increasing morbidity and mortality. 
The aim of the present study is to gain knowledge about the sociodemographic characteristics, as well as the functional features, of patients admitted to hospital with PF and evaluated by a Geriatrics department. 
The functional burden of PF and the potential influence of geriatric interventions are also assessed.

Material and methods.
A retrospective study conducted between 1995 and 2015 on all patients older than 65 years old with PF admitted to the Traumatology department, and then assessed in the Geriatrics Department. 
Sociodemographic information was also collected (age, gender and place of residence), as well as data from the geriatric assessment (baseline situation and at hospital admission), hospital stay, within hospital mortality, and discharge.

Results.
The study included 271 patients with a mean age of 81.1±7 years, and mainly women (81.2%). 
The median hospital stay was 9 days (interquartile range 5 to 14 days). 
The ability to walk independently decreased after PF from 72.3% to 3.6%. 
Severe disability cases increased in activities of daily living from 7.9% to 79.5%. 
Within hospital mortality was 2.2%. 
As regards medical follow-up consultations, the mean length of stay was significantly reduced compared to the assessment consultations (10.0±7.8 vs 16.1±12.0 days, P<.001).
Conclusion.
PF patients evaluated by the Geriatrics Department were mainly women, with advanced age, and a severe functional impairment secondary to PF. 
The intervention of a geriatrician could contribute to optimise hospital resources.
