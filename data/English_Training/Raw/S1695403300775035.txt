Objectives
To describe the implementation of a program for the early detection of deafness in newborn infants in a private hospital.
Materials and methods
Between August 1, 1994 and July 31, 1999, 1,750 neonates from the nursery and neonatology unit of our hospital were studied using evoked acoustic emissions (EAE).
Screening was performed after the first 24 hours of life and after parent consent had been obtained.
Results
The coverage (number of neonates screened using otoa-coustic emissions compared with the total number of live births) increased from 6% in 1994 to 37.5% in 1999.
Six mild-moderate neurosensory hypoacusis were detected; overall results were 4 % hypoacusis and 2.3 % bilateral hy-poacusis.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that hardness of hearing can be detected at birth by means of EAE.
Because of lack of awareness in the general population, universal screening is difficult.
Consequently, governments and medical organizations should legislate for such screening programs and should make the general population aware of them.
