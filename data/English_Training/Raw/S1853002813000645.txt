Abstract
 Cognitive impairment may compromise driving skills and represent a public health risk by increasing traffic accidents.
Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia are characterized by cognitive impairment affecting to a greater or lesser degree the instrumental activities of daily living and fitness to drive.
The Argentine Neurologic Society Working Group on Behavioural Neurology and Cognitive Neurosciences has prepared this clinical practice guideline to help physicians evaluate patients suspected to present cognitive impairment or dementia and detect and prevent risky behaviors.
