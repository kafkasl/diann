Abstract
 Objective
To identify the prevalence of the cardiovascular risk (RCV) in users with a Severe Mental Disorder (SMD) attended in mental health service in ParcTaulí (Sabadell - Barcelona).
Method
This is an observational, descriptive and transversal study of the factors of cardiovascular risk in 789 users with SMD.
The instrument used was the scale of assessment of the Registre Gironí del Cor, which estimates the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Results
26.6% of the sample has RCV (22.5% moderate, 3.8% high and 0.3% very high).
The analysis of the modifiable risk factors shows that 16.5% of the patients are hypertensive, 55.2% are smokers, 19.77% have hyperglycaemia (8.2% of whom are diagnosed of diabetes mellitus), 40.2% have obesity, 36.2% overweight and 47.27% hypercholesterolemia.
Conclusions
The study confirms that the prevalence of the RVC in SMD users is greater than the RCV in general population and it's associated to the presence of modifiable risk factors.
Health education carried out by nurses is the best to prevent the RCV in SMD users.
