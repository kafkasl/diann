Introduction
REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterised by violent behaviours (screaming, kicking, vivid dreams) during REM sleep. 
It has a prevalence of 1% to 2% of the general population and is especially frequent in men and the population older than 60. 
In the last decade, RBD has been suggested to be a prodrome of neurodegenerative disease. 
We analysed associated neurological diseases and responses to drug treatment in 33 patients with RBD treated in the multidisciplinary sleep disorders unit at Hospital Infanta Sofía.
Patients and methods
We conducted an observational descriptive retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with RBD and treated in our multidisciplinary sleep disorders unit between October 2012 and December 2015. 
We recorded age, sex, associated diseases, and treatments administered to these patients.
Results
A total of 365 patients were attended at our unit, including 33 with RBD: 13 women (40%) and 20 men (60%). 
Mean age was 62.72 years. 
An associated disorder was identified in 48%, with the most common being mild cognitive impairment (69%). 
The percentage of patients with RBD and an associated disorder among patients older than 60 was 68%. 
Eighty-two percent of the patients required treatment. 
The most commonly used drug was clonazepam (76%), followed by melatonin (9%), gabapentin (6%), and trazodone (3%).
Discussion
In our series, 48% of the patients had an associated disorder. 
The likelihood of detecting an associated disorder increases with patients’ age. 
The vast majority of patients required drug treatment due to symptom severity; the most frequently administered drug was clonazepam (76%).
