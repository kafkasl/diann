Summary
Cockayne syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by physical and psychomotor retardation, progressive neurological disfunction, photosensitivity, ophthalmological abnormalities, neurosensorial deafness and other pathologic features such as leucodistrophy and calcifications in the central nervous system with segmental demyelination in the peripheral nervous system.
In this work we report a clinical case of an eleven years old patient with Cockayne syndrome.
This patient presents a mixed picture with growth and psychomotor retardation, ataxia, muscle tone alterations, orthopedic problems, sensorial disfunctions and speech problems.
We describe the therapies used, including an individualized complete Rehabilitation program in order to improve the patient quality of life.
