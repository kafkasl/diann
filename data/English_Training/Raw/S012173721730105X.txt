Objective
To obtain a clinical and socio-demographic profile of a group of elders of the community who participated in Memory Maintenance and Conservation activities.
Materials and methods
A series of 21 elders in whom cognoscitive status was determined applying the NEUROPSI Test and the presence of somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). 
Life satisfaction was assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Scale.
Results
Twenty-one elders, average age 73.5 years (SD: 7.3 years), range: 57-82, 90.5% female; 71.4% reported no current marital relationship, in 66.5% educational level ranged from 1 to 5 years, 42.9% assiduously attended the activities during the last 6 years, 76.2% had no cognoscitive impairment, 90.5% no somatic symptoms, 90.5% no anxiety, 95.2% no social dysfunction, 95.2% no depression and 76.1% reported being satisfied with their life.
Conclusions
Absence of cognoscitive deterioration is similar to that within the general population. 
Participants did not report depression, anxiety or somatic complaints, showed good social functioning and integration level and were satisfied with their life. 
Despite the limitations associated with small sample size, the results encourage us to continue this work and to engage in more rigorous research.
