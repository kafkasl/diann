Abstract
 Introduction
Comorbidity studies of frequency of OCD or OCD symptoms and schizophrenia show very high variability.
The presence of these symptoms in schizophrenia has been related to factors like severity of disease.
The objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and to evaluate its relationship with clinical characteristics.
Results
A total of 222 patients have been evaluated using SANS, SAPS, BPRS, EMUN and Zung scales and the Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist.
No cases of OCD have been found.
The frequency of OCD symptoms was 4.5% (95% CI 2.2% 8.1%).
OCD symptoms were associated with social and cognitive impairment.
Conclusions
OCD and OCD symptoms represent distinct dimensions in schizophrenic patients.
Its presence in different stages of the disease could indicate impairment or protection against more disruptive signs of psychosis.
