Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for patients with medical treatment-resistant morbid obesity. 
Improves anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risks and life quality. 
However, bariatric surgery procedures increases the risk of nutritional deficit, and can cause postoperative neurological complications as encephalopathy, ataxia or polyneuropathies; or aggravate an existing neuropathy. 
Usually, these complications are more frequent in malabsorptive procedures than in restrictive ones.
We present a clinical case of a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia who undergoes bariatric surgery. 
Successfully, bariatric surgery has been achieved in a patient with ataxia and hypoalbuminemia, without nutritional or neurological worsening in the medium term.
