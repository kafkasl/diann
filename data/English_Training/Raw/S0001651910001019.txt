Abstract
 Introduction
Endoscopic sinus surgery presents a series of complications that can vary depending on the technique used and the surgeon's experience.
This technique needs a learning curve, which must be developed during the residence training program.
Methods
Descriptive and retrospective study, reviewing the medical records of endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyps of 192 patients who had undergone operations performed by residents at our department between January 2002 and January 2008.
Patient sex, age, affectation scale and minor and major complications were described.
All these procedures were performed by 3rd or 4th-year residents under the supervision of a faculty member.
Results
Of the 192 patients, 127 (66.14%) were male and 65 (33.85%) female, aged between 24 and 78 years old, with a mean age of 49 years old.
Nasal endoscopy revealed polyposis of grade i, 19 (9.8%) cases; grade ii, 55 (28.6%); and grade iii, 118 (61.45%).
There were 44 (22.9%) total complications, 40 (20.8%) minor and 4 (2.08%) major complications.
The most common minor complication was synechia formation in 21(10.93%) cases, followed by bleeding without need for transfusion in 12 (6.25%).
The major complication was a breach of the lamina papyracea in 4 patients (2.08%).
There were no cases of blindness, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, or death.
Conclusions
Endoscopic sinus surgery in an otolaryngology residency training program is a relatively safe procedure, especially when performed under faculty supervision.
