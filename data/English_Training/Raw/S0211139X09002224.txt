Abstract
 Introduction
A major challenge for gerontological research is to differentiate adequately between old adults with poor performance on cognitive tasks due to depression, and those who present cognitive impairment associated with dementia.
In view of the fact that cognitive plasticity has already proved to be efficient in the diagnosis of age-associated cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment and dementia, the objective of this study is to investigate the possibility that it may also prove useful in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders.
Materials and methods
A total of 50 old adults participated in the study.
These completed the Positions Test (PT) and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test of Learning Potential (AVLT-LP) as measures of cognitive plasticity.
Participants also undertook the Spanish version of Mini Mental State (MEC), Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
Socio-demographic data were also collected.
Results
With regard to cognitive plasticity, depressed old adults do not differ from those without depression.
On the other hand, old adults with cognitive impairment present less cognitive plasticity than those without cognitive impairment.
Conclusion
Cognitive plasticity appears to be a relevant variable in the differentiation between old people with low cognitive performance due to depression and old people with cognitive impairment.
