Introduction
Numerous tests have been developed to help in the diagnosis of the immunomediated inner ear disease (IMIED), although their usefulness is still the subject of some dispute.
Material and method
Studies of cohorts of patients with suspected IMIED have been reviewed.
A number of different serological tests were carried out and their response to immunosuppressive therapy was noted.
Results
After reviewing 790 articles, the studies analyzed present great heterogeneity in the clinical characteristics of the patients recruited (sudden deafness, fluctuating and rapidly progressive hearing loss, Meni√®re's disease), the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the delay between the diagnosis and the start of medical treatment or the response criteria.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of IMIED is based on clinical presentation and response to corticosteroids.
At present no test represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of IMIED.
Serologic tests can support the diagnosis, but a methodologically more rigorous approach is needed to identify the true clinical importance of these tests for daily practice.
