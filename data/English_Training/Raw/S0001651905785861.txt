Abstract
 We present an 8 years patient old with a giant dilatation of the vestibular aqueduct associated with profound and progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
The patient received a cochlear implant and during the surgery a pulsatile clear fluid via the cochleostomy was observed, without gusher.
We present all the problems, and offer some advices for this kind of surgery.
