We report the case of a 58-year old male patient who in the last month had two drop attacks with strength loss in both upper and lower left limbs; the patient had dysarthria and the clinical picture resolved spontaneously.
He was diagnosed ot transient ischemic attacks (TIA).
He had no cardiovascular risk factors and blood pressure was normal.
After a specific neurological investigation and study of the possible etiology or risk factors no evidence was observed.
A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed and the white coat normotension phenomenon was observed as the likely risk factor for the attack.
The prevalence, diagnosis, reproducibility, association with other variables and its clinical significance are analyzed.
