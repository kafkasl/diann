Objective.
To evaluate the impact of a socio-educational intervention to improve the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia.

Method.
Out of 132 eligible candidates, 128 patients participated with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (ACR 1990/2010), over 18 years of age, who did not have cognitive problems or mental disorders in acute phase and lived in the catchment area of the participating CAPs. 
The patients underwent intervention for 5 weeks to strengthen self-management of pain and improve quality of life. 
Socio-demographic variables, satisfaction and quality of life (SF-36) were studied. 
Pre-post measurements were made on the 128 participants and follow-up at 2 months on 120 (8 did not agree to be contacted).

Results.
Comparing the pre-post-intervention scores (non-parametric Wilcoxon test), it was found that 71.09% reported a higher perception of quality of life in the Mental health domain and lower percentage of improvement (28.91%) in the Physical role domain. 
When comparing pre-post-follow-up scores (Friedman's test), mean perception improved in all domains and remained at 2-month follow-up (P<.001). 
Finally, the average satisfaction with the intervention received was 90.55% (SD 9.86; min. 41, max. 100).

Conclusions.
When assessing the impact of the intervention, there was an improvement in the post and follow-up scores. 
This finding is largely due to the fact that the intervention strengthens the patient's self-mastery of their abilities to control pain and improve their perception of quality of life.
