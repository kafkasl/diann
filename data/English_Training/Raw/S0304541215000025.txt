Abstract
 Dementia is a syndrome characterized by acquired cognitive deficit, or behavioral syntoms that interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities.
Its prevalence increases with age, and in those aged >65 years ranges between 5-14,9%, and progressive aging of the population predicts a significant increase in it.
Globally the most common cause is Alzheimer disease.
In addition to age, several genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of developing dementia.
Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria.
The initial evaluation intends to detect cognitive impairment, to determine the decline from previous levels of functioning and to rule out other entities that may present with cognitive complaints.
Dementia is usually divided into primary and secondary categories.
Ancillary tests are used to rule out the latter.
