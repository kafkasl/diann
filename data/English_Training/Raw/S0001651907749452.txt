Objective
The objective of this paper is to make a retrospective analysis in patients with glomus tumours of temporal bone origin.
We present the results according to the surgical approach applied in each case.
Patients and method
This retrospective study presents the findings in 17 patients with diagnosis of glomus jugulare of the temporal bone, who were observed and treated in our department over a 5-year period (1999 to 2004).
We performed a general otolaryngology exam, systemic evaluation and radiological exam.
Surgical treatment was performed in 16 cases out of 17.
In 1 case treatment with stereotaxic surgery was performed.
Results
The surgical approaches were: retroauricular transcanal approach, radical or modified mastoidectomy through facial recess, and infratemporal fossa approach.
Pre-operative embolization was used in 11 of our cases.
In all cases the diagnosis of glomus tumour was confirmed.
The most frequent post-operative complications found were: transitory paralysis of the facial nerve, sensorineural hearing loss, imbalance, paralysis of the IXth and XIth cranial nerves, and salivary fistula.
No recurrences were found after 8 years of follow-up.
One case of persistence was found in the case treated with radiosurgery.
Conclusions
In our series surgery was found as the elective therapy for patients with glomus tumour of the temporal bone with no recurrences after 8 years of follow-up.
Pre-operative embolization diminishes surgery time and intraoperative bleeding.
Stereotaxic therapy cannot provide tumour growth control.
Complications are discussed and compared with the bibliography.
