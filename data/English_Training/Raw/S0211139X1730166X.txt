Introduction.
The prevalence of cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND) varies between 5.1% and 35.9%, increasing between 65 and 85 years. 
The CIND increases the risk of dementia. 
Factors such as education, occupation, and social activities are associated with the risk of cognitive impairment. 
The main objective of this study was to analyse the association between the main occupation developed throughout life and CIND in a general population sample of over 55 years.

Methods.
In wave I of the ZARADEMP Project, a sample (n=4803) of people over 55 years was interviewed. 
CIND measurement was obtained through the Mini Mental State Examination. 
Occupational activity data were recoded into white collar, blue collar, homemakers, and farmers. 
The association between the occupation variables and CIND was estimated using the odds ratio, and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression equations.

Results.
The prevalence of CIND in the sample was 28.2%. 
As regards white collar workers, the CIND diagnosis odds was 53% higher for blue collar workers, 77% higher for women who were homemakers and almost twice for farmers, after controlling for socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical variables. 
All results were statistically significant.

Conclusions.
CIND frequency is influenced by the previous occupation of the subjects. 
An occupation with higher intellectual requirements can help keep cognitive functions intact for longer.
