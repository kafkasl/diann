Abstract
 Introduction and objective
Hearing plays an essential role in the acquisition, development and maintenance of the properties of the speech and language.
Birth weight is an indicator of biological maturation of the newborn.
Premature newborns with very low birth weight (VLBW<1500 g) constitute a group with the highest risk of sensorineural hearing loss.
Our objective was to ascertain the degree of hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and presence of the association to other risk factors for hearing loss in VLBW infants included in the Universal Hearing Loss Screening Programme at the University Mother-Child Hospital of Gran Canaria (Spain) in the 2007â€“2010 period.
Material and methods
This was a retrospective study of 364 infants with VLBW, measured by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response.
Results
There were 112 newborns (30.8%) referred for auditory brainstem response.
A diagnosis of hearing loss was given to 22 newborns (2.2%), 14 had conductive hearing loss and 8, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), of which 2 had bilateral profound hearing loss.
The VLBW newborns presented the association to another risk factor in more than a quarter of the sample studied.
All those diagnosed with SNHL were premature.
Conclusions
The percentage of VLBW newborns diagnosed with hearing loss is higher than expected in the general population.
All those diagnosed with SNHL were premature and presented one or 2 hearing risk factors associated with VLBW.
