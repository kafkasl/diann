The features of Wernicke's encephalopathy have been described as a combination of confusion, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. 
Encephalopathy can complicate hyperemesis gravidarum because it impairs correct absorption of an adequate amount of thiamine and can cause electrolyte imbalance. 
We present the case of a 22-year-old primipara who was admitted to hospital due to lethargy, generalized weakness, ophthalmoplegia, language disturbance, and weight loss in her 12th week of pregnancy. 
The patient had a history of hyperemesis gravidarum three weeks before admission. 
Physical examination revealed a lethargic patient with horizontal nystagmus, ataxia, and symmetric hyporeflexia. 
Parenteral thiamine therapy was started. 
The patient recovered from the neurological deficits after 6 weeks of treatment.
