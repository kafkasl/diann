Abstract
 The elderly population is currently increasing.
In this population there is a high incidence of cognitive decline and dementia, which has a negative influence on personal life and family functioning, as well as economic and healthcare repercussions.
The present article aims to indicate possible predictors of cognitive decline with a view to predicting this situation and intervening before the cognitive impairment is unavoidable.
Some predictors of cognitive impairment could be the following: age, sex, education, a family history of dementia, objective and subjective difficulties with memory, several medical problems (hypertension and diabetes), sensory- motor difficulties, hypometabolism in some cerebral areas, reduced hippocampal size, carrying one or two apolipoprotein e4 alleles, a low score in cognitive tasks (especially immediate and delayed recall), deficits in associative learning and naming, low cognitive plasticity, depression, a low literacy level, poor general cognitive functioning, low participation in social activities, low physical activity, lack of social support, the use of medication and, finally, sleep-related problems.
All of these factors could be important in predicting cognitive decline in very old age.
