An ischaemic infarction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) is usually associated with vertigo, hearing loss, facial palsy, nystagmus, or truncal ataxia; it is often accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs.
Suddenonset bilateral hearing loss without associated neurological symptoms is infrequent in the literature.
We report a case of sudden bilateral hearing loss, later diagnosed as AICA infarction without other symptoms.
