Antiphospholipid syndrome can be associated with several neurological manifestations.
The most common symptom is headache.
It has also been associated with cognitive dysfunction, probably due to ischemia.
A high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies has been found in patients with epilepsy and in transverse myelitis.
The most common thrombotic manifestation is stroke.
Venous thrombosis can also be found, yet it is less frequent.
A stroke in a young person obliges to rule out the antiphospholipid syndrome.
The neurological manifestations can mimic multiple sclerosis.
Thus, determination of antiphospholipid antibodies is recommended in the study of patients with atypical manifestations of multiple sclerosis.
Other manifestations associated with antiphospholipid antibodies include chorea, neurosensorial deafness, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and psychotic disorders.
