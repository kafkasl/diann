Abstract
 Objective
To describe growth and neurodevelopmental status of 4,944 children who completed a follow-up at two years of corrected age out of the 10,456 newborns with weight ≤ 1500 g born between the years 2002-2007 and discharged from hospitals within the network SEN1500.
A total of 522 newborns were excluded as they had some type of malformation.
The total number of children assessed represents the 49.76% of children discharged alive and without malformations.
Methods
A retrospective review was conducted using prospectively collected data in the SEN1500 database.
We compared growth data at two years of corrected age according to birth weight and sex.
Motor impairment, incidence of cerebral palsy, visual and hearing disabilities, and abnormal neurodevelopment for gestational age were analysed between groups.
We studied the associations between cerebral palsy (CP) and perinatal factors.
Results
At 2 years of age 44.2% of children had a weight < 2 SD for corrected age.
Children with birth weight ≤ 1000 g showed worse outcomes in growth.
Some type of motor impairment was observed in 6.96% of the infants, and 4.56% of them were diagnosed with CP.
The incidence was higher among males with birth weight ≤ 1000g. 
There was an incidence of 5.21% of visual disability, with 0.5% of children being blind in one or both eyes.
Cerebral palsy was associated with retinopathy of prematurity, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia, in particular cystic periventricular leukomalacia.
