Abstract
 Like anyone else, people with Down syndrome can suffer mental health problems that require diagnosis, treatment and prevention.
The higher number of depressions seen in recent years is a cause for concern and must be taken on by health professionals and families.
Depression is difficult to diagnose in people with Down syndrome as its symptoms can be mistaken with those of other conditions.
This paper sets out to define depression, highlight the specific manifestation of symptoms and give guidelines on how it can be diagnosed and treated.
Importance is also placed on prevention.
