In this research, it is presented an intervention program that combines storytelling with morphosyntactic activities to improve grammatical skills in pupils with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). 
The sample consisted of a total of 34 pupils diagnosed with SLI and 34 children with typical language development. 
For the selection of the sample, the CELF-3 test, the Peabody test, the Hearing Association and Visual Association subtests of the ITPA and the K-BIT Intelligence test were used. 
The intervention program consisted of 216 sessions of 40minutes each, in which oral narrative activities were combined with other activities related to the automation of morphosyntactic skills. 
Significant gains were also made in the group of children with SLI versus controls in total ungrammaticality, ungrammatical sentences, morphological and syntactical errors. 
In conclusion, a combined program of both storytelling and morphosyntactic skills improves grammatical achievement in pupils with SLI.
