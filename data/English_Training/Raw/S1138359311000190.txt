Abstract
 Cognitive impairment is becoming increasingly more common in primary care, and not all is due to Alzheimer's disease or Vascular Dementia.
Other diagnostic possibilities, such as normotensive hydrocephalus or chronic adult hydrocephalus also have very similar signs.
A clinical case of normotensive hydrocephalus is presented, a condition that is characterised by a typical triad: Gait disturbance, dementia and urinary incontinence.
