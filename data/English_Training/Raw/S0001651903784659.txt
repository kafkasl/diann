Abstract
 Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) of 50 newborn with negative transient evoked acoustic emissions (OEAT) was performed.
54% of them had no family history of sensorineural hearing loss (SHNL) and no risk factors were found.
In 70% of cases ABR recording was negative.
Follow up did show that 60% of them had normal recordings of hearing and in a 40% different stages of hearing loss were seen.
To establish a definitive diagnosis a 1 to 9 month period is necessary.
