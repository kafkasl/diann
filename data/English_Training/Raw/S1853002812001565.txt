Abstract
 Introduction
Basic emotions are biologically determined emotional states, their expression and recognition is universal and innate.
Complex emotions arise from the combination of basic emotions and their recognition is achieved by means of Theory of Mind (ToM).
Objective
To investigate the presence of alterations in facial recognition of basic emotions (FRBE) and its relation to the recognition of complex emotions in a group of patients with beheavioural variant of Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD).
Patients and methods
Sixty pictures from the Pictures of Facial Affect set were selected based on Calder et al.
(1996) selection and a three tests battery for FRBE was administrated.
The test of complex emotions Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) was also administered.
Subjects: A cohort of 14 patients diagnosed with bvFTD from Laboratorio de Deterioro Cognitivo - HIGA Eva Per√≥n, and a control group for FRBE tasks.
A multiple study of isolated cases was conducted.
Results
Significant differences between controls and patients were found for FRBE.
RME showed correlations with the three tasks FRBE: Selection (r: .570, _P_ = .034), Mating (r: .600, _P_ = .023), and Naming (r: .770, _P_ = .001).
Double dissociations were observed between LMO and RFEB tasks.
Conclusions
The presence of group-level correlations could indicate that basic emotions are involved in the formation of secondary emotions.
However, the presence of double dissociations between tasks could indicate that its execution involves partially independent processes.
