Abstract
 There is growing acceptance that pregnancy itself is not a protective factor against mental disorders.
Indeed, some mental disorders such as psychotic and bipolar disorders may become worse during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period.
In pregnant women with a mental disorder that can be treated with antipsychotics, the known risks—teratogenic, obstetric, neonatal and those affecting the mother— indicate that, in general, the risk of the non-treated disorder is higher than that resulting from the use of antipsychotics and that the reduction in psychoticism improves the overall prognosis of these women.
All the antipsychotics marketed in Spain are included in category C of the US Food and Drug Administration, with the exception of clozapine and piperazine, which are included in category B.
The use of all of these drugs should be avoided during breast feeding as far as possible.
The most reliable current recommendations indicate that optimal control of severe mental disorders should be maintained during pregnancy, the postpartum and subsequent periods.
These recommendations also indicate that women with mental disorders must be considered as high risk and that both these women and their pregnancies should be constantly monitored.
The currently available scientific information does not allow more than relatively secure individually-tailored recommendations to be made.
When taking the decision of whether or not to treat with antipsychotics, the use of a risk- benefit relationship is crucial, with the participation of the woman's partner or legal representative, other physicians and even the clinical pharmacist if necessary.
