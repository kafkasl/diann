Abstract
The aim of this study was to examine the results of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (Teoae) as screening test for hearing impairment in newborn infants.
We examined 9.951 of 11.405 infants born in our city from January 1st, (1995), to December 31st, (1998).
A Teoae test was performed prior to discharge and repeated one week later in cases who failed the first Teoae.
In case of suspected hearing loss auditory brainstem response (Abr) was performed 3 months later.
Hearing loss was defined as Abr threshold >20 Db.
157 infants (1,5%) were identified with hearing loss.
Screening with Teoae was sufficiently sensitive in identification of congenital hearing impairment and the efficacy increased with the experience.
