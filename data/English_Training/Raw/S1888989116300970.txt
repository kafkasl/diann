Introduction
The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for People with Learning Disabilities (HoNOS-LD) is a brief instrument that assesses functioning in people with intellectual development disorder and mental health problems/behaviour disorders. 
The aim of the present study was to examine the evidence on the validity of the scores based on the Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD.
Material and methods
The study included 111 participants that were assessed by the Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD and other questionnaires that measured different variables related to the scale. 
Thirty-three participants were assessed by 2 examiners, and retested 7 days later, in order to study inter-examiner reliability and test-retest reliabilities.
Results
Based on clinical and conceptual criteria, and on the results of the parallel analysis, a factorial solution with one factor was selected. 
Internal consistency was good (Omega coefficient of 0.87). 
Inter-examiner and test-retest reliabilities were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.98, respectively). 
Correlations between sections of the HoNOS-LD and the related instruments showed the expected direction, and were highly significant (P<.001), and the HoNOS-LD score increased with the intensity of the support required by the participants. 
These results showed evidence of the validity of association with other external variables.
Conclusions
The Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD is a brief, valid and reliable instrument, which will enable a routine assessment of functioning for different uses, including diagnosis and intervention.
