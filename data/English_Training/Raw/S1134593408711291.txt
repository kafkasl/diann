Diogenes syndrome is a behavioural disorder of the elderly.
Symptoms include social isolation, domestic squalor, hoarding rubbish, self-neglect, and refusing external help.
According to the literature, approximately half of the patients with this syndrome have a mental disorder.
We report 3 cases of Diogenes syndrome representing 3 different clinical forms: the primary type, associated with a personality disorder, the secondary type due to dementia, and the secondary type associated with different mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence).
