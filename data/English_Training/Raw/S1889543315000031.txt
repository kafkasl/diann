Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prevalence of dementias in individuals over 65 years old and their relationship with sex and age.
Material and methods
A descriptive study of prevalence was conducted on the population of Trobajo del Camino (Trobajo-Valverde Health Centre), belonging to the municipality of San Andr√©s del Rabanedo in the Province of Leon.
The medical records of all patients over 65 years were reviewed.
Those who had been given a diagnosis of any type of dementia were recorded.
The study included 9603 inhabitants, of which 1542 were at least 65 years of age, and formed the sample of this study.
This sample (869 women and 673 men) was 16.1% of the total population studied.
Results
The prevalence of dementias in over 65 year-olds was 4.9%, and was directly proportional with age.
The disease was more prevalent in women (5.6%).
The most frequent type was Alzheimer disease (2.6%), and the least frequent was progressive supranuclear palsy (0.1%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of dementias was around 5% in the population over 65 years.
A directly proportional relationship with age was obtained, and was more prevalent in women.
