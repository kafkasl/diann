Social cognition in schizophrenia is currently one of the major fields of interest in studies of this disorder. 
It is commonly conceptualised as a set of mental operations underlying social interactions, and therefore related to the ability to interpret and predict the behaviour of others in different social contexts. 
The research community has defined the functional areas that constitute the domain of social cognition, including, at least, the theory of mind, sensory perception, social perception, and attributional bias. 
Different bodies of evidence have shown that alterations in these functions in patients with schizophrenia are linked to some of their main psychopathological dysfunctions, such as defects in sensory perception, insight and attributional origin, and authorship of human acts. 
These behavioural alterations have been linked to structural and functional disturbances in the constituents of the so-called social brain. 
This includes a set of medial parietal, temporal, and pre-frontal areas that have been associated with some anomalies in the theory of mind, the perception of emotions, and the ability to consider the perspective of others, phenomena commonly found in schizophrenia. 
Future research in the domain of social cognition should be aimed at clarifying its relationship with the social brain and neurocognition.
