Abstract
 Turner syndrome (TS) is the human being's most frequent sex chromosome abnormality.
Progressive sensorineural hearing loss is documented in more than 50% of the women affected by this syndrome.
Although Mondini defect is the cochlear congenital malformation most frequently identified in other polymalformative syndromes, it has rarely been reported in TS.
We describe the case of a 32-year-old woman with TS who presented progressive sensorineural hearing loss.
The computed tomography of the ears showed bilateral Mondini deformity.
