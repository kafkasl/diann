Abstract
 Introduction
The aim of our study is to describe the epidemiology, clinical evolution, and the anatomical and neurological factors involved in polymicrogyria in 34 patients with this disorder.
Subjects and methods
We have compiled 34 patients diagnosed and/or in follow-up at the Department of Paediatric Neurology of the Hospital Infantil Niño Jesús between 1995 and 2010.
All the patients had a magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of polymicrogyria, and most of the patients still have periodic checks, thus their outcome is known.
Results
The large majority were male (76.5%).
The median age at presentation was 10 months; the reason for the study was psychomotor or mental delay (44%) followed by seizures (38.2%).
During the condition patients presented with epilepsy (61.7%), infantile cerebral palsy (47%), psychomotor/mental retardation (94.1%), pervasive developmental disorder (26.4%), behavioural disturbances (38.2%), neurosensory deficit (35.2%) and microcephaly 67.6%.
In 82.3% of patients there was bilateral involvement (42.8% perisylvian).
Other abnormalities were observed in the MRI of 58.8% of patients.
The electroencephalogram at diagnosis showed changes in 41.1%, and this rose to 67.6% during follow-up.
61.7% received antiepileptic treatment was received by 61.7% of patients, with 52.3% requiring ≥2 drugs.
Epilepsy surgery was performed on two patients.
Some type of sequelae was observed in 91.1% of patients.
The aetiology was unknown in 61.7%; a congenital infection was suspected in 10 patients and syndromic or polymalformative disorder in three patients.
Conclusions
This study shows the range of clinical and radiological expression in polymicrogyria, in addition to the possibilities for the future in terms of determining the aetiology of this pathology.
