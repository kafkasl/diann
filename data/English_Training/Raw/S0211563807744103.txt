Abstract
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflamatory and demyelinative disease which affects central nervous system myelin.
The most characteristic clinic in MS is its variability, with signs and symptoms depending on the localitation of the injuries which can appear in all neuroaxis.
Today there isnâ€™t a healing therapy in MS.
Thats why physiotherapy acquires an important value to maintain and/or improve the patient functional status.
Physiotherapist must adapt the treatment to the patient all the time, attending the disturbances which can appear when the disease progress.
The most common symptoms, spasticity, weakness, ataxia, fatigue and gait disturbances, will appear in a great number of patients with MS.
The physiotherapist role is to reduce these injuries through kynesitherapy and neurological physiotherapy techniques, in order to maintain an acceptable patient's life quality.
