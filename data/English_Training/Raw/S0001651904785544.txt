Abstract
 Objectives
To analize the results of patients with cohlear implants in postlingual adults with progressive hearing loss and to analize various predictive factors.
Material and methods
Prospective study of 42 patients with profound and progressive hearing loss.
We analized the outcomes in the first two years of follow-up.
We examined the results in regards to the of age at time of implantation, other handicaps, cause of hearing loss, age of onset, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes.
We use the logo-auditory protocol developed at the University Spanish of navarra.
Results
All tests presented a significative improvement in the first six months (p<0.01 Student t or Wilcoxon test).
After six months the results were not statistically significant.
The more important predictive factors were percentage of life with hearing loss, percentage of life with profound hearing loss, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes thus the significancy was more relevant at a follow-up period of 3 months (p<0.05 Student t or Mann- Withney test).
Conclusions
These patients showed clear benefits in a short period of time and the patients with unfavourable circumstances had a more slow progression but a similar final outcome
