Introduction
Oropharyngeal dysphagia is one of the lesser known geriatric syndromes, despite its enormous impact on functional capacity, quality of life, and health of those affected.
Material and methods
A descriptive and prospective study was conducted by the Geriatric Department of Barbastro Hospital (Huesca), from March 2012 to October 2014, as biannual and annual reviews in October 2015. 
This study included all patients on whom a volume-viscosity clinical examination (MECV-V test) was performed to suspecting dysphagia.
Results
The study included 266 patients with a mean age of 82.35±12.3 years, and with a mean Barthel index score of 20.5±25.4, and mean Charlson index of 1.77±1.6. 
The test was performed in 105 cases after stroke (40%), 53 in dementia (20%), 24 in Parkinsonism (9%), and for other different reasons in 80 (31%). 
Dysphagia was diagnosed in 228 (86%) cases. 
Enteral nutrition was given in 25 (10.9%) cases. 
The test results were shown in the discharge report in 45% of the tests with positive result. 
The mean survival obtained after test in the patients who died was 230.8±256.5 days. 
Differences in survival at 12 months were found in patients with positive test, without finding a clear relationship with functional status and comorbidity.
Conclusions
Dysphagia has a significant mortality, and the use of thickeners after its detection should be properly reported.
