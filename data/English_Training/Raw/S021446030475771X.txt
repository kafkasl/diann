Deafblindness is a unique disability characterized by multisensory deprivation of auditory and visual systems.
Most of deafblind patients have sensory residuary capacities that may become a fundamental tool in rehabilitation if they can be used as an advantage correctly.
We proposed auditory evoked potentials (AEP) as a useful alternative to identify objectively auditory residuary capacities in deafblind patients.
Six subjects (mean age: 13 years) with congenital deafblindness, brain damage and severe to profound hearing losses were included in this study.
All cases were evaluated (air conduction) with click auditory brainstem response (ABR) and multiple auditory steady state response (MSSR) as a combination of 4 carrier tones amplitude modulated (95 % depth) of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz.
Both AEP were recorded using the AUDIX system.
We have found residual hearing in all the patients even in those which no click ABR was recorded at the maximum stimulation levels.
The MSSR provides additional information about the contourand degree of the existing hearing impairment.
The lowest difference between ABR and MSSR mean thresholds was at 4 kHz, and the largest was at 0.5 kHz.
AEP are reliable techniques for objective evaluation of hearing in deafblind patients.
The MSSR evaluated more precisely the residual hearing and may provide a potential advantage over click ABR for the audiometric thresholds estimation in deafblind patients with severe or profound hearing losses.
