Introduction
Individuals with dementia suffer from changes at a cognitive, emotional, and behavioural level. 
These changes can also affect the quality of life of their caregivers in a physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension.
Objective
Determine the perception of life quality, taking into account the burden of caregivers of patients with dementia.
Method
A descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study was conducted on an intentional sample of 50 caregivers of patients diagnosed with dementia. 
The information was collected using three tools: socio-demographic variables, quality of life, and dimension of caregiver's burden.
Results
The sample consisted of 80% women, with an age range of 36â€“59 years, of whom 54% were married. 
More than three-quarters (78%) of them had been a caregiver for more than 37 months, and 66% dedicated 24h to the work of caring. 
The main caregivers experience a low care burden and low effect on their quality of life.
Conclusions
The study shows the presence of women in the role of caregivers, the relationship between the quality life and burden, and how they are influenced by the physical and psychological dimensions. 
Similarly, a low social well-being negatively influences the quality life.
