Abstract
 Objective
Previous research supports the relationship between the use of alcohol and other drugs and mental disorders.
The aim of this study was to analyse the association between drug and alcohol use prior to incarceration and the current prevalence of mental disorders among the incarcerated population in Spain.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted, including to 2709 incarcerated subjects (2484 males and 225 females) from a total of 8 prisons.
A self-administered anonymous and voluntary questionnaire was used.
The prevalence of psychoactive substance use prior to imprisonment and the current prevalence of mental disorders was calculated.
The association between the two variables was analysed with logistic regression for both genders.
Results
Alcohol was the most consumed substance in the 6 months prior to detention for both men and women (68.5 and 48.9%, respectively) followed by cannabis (50.9 and 38.2%, respectively).
The prevalence of mental disorders in prison was statically significant for men and women (24.9 and 34.2%, respectively).
Most of the psychoactive substances analysed involve a risk factor for current mental disorder, especially as regards the use of psychotropic drugs (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.54–2.71) and cannabis (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47–2.24).
Discussion
We found an association between alcohol and drug use and the current prevalence of mental disorders among the incarcerated population sample.
Furthermore, it is recommended to develop effective protocols for treatment and rehabilitation programmes in prison.
These should suit inmates’ history of drug and alcohol use to improve mental health strategies.
