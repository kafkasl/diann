Background
Cardiovascular and metabolic monitoring of patients on antipsychotic medication is essential. 
This becomes more important in those of paediatric age, as they are more vulnerable, and also because prescriptions of this kind of drugs are still increasing.
Aim
To evaluate the monitoring of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in a group of children and young people on antipsychotic medication.
Method
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in which a group of 220 patients aged 8-17 years, diagnosed with a mental disorder and on antipsychotic treatment. 
They were compared to a control group of 199 asthmatic patients not exposed to antipsychotic drugs. 
Data was extracted from the computerised clinical history ECAP in 2013.
Results
The mean age of the children was 12 years (8-17). 
Risperidone (67%) was the most frequent treatment. 
The recording of Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood pressure (AP) was 50% in Mental Disorder (MD) patients. 
A higher number of cardiovascular monitoring physical parameters (weight, height, BMI and BP) were observed in the MD group compared to the control Asthma control group. 
Altogether, more physical parameters than biochemistry parameters were recorded.
Conclusions
This study shows that the recording of cardiovascular parameters and metabolic studies needs to be improved in children and adolescents on treatment with antipsychotics.
