Abstract
 We report the case of a 67-year-old male diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma, who referred dysphagia, dysphonia and noticed the appearance of a laterocervical mass.
A CT scan revealed an osteolytic soft tissue neck lesion, which was resected.
Its anatomical-pathological study was compatible with metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma.
