Primary varicella-zoster infection is very common during childhood and few patients develop complications.
The most frequent complications are bacterial infection of the lesions, laryngitis and varicella pneumonia.
In the nervous system it can produce encephalitis and especially cerebellitis.
We describe a case of primary varicella-zoster induced rhabdomyolysis in a 5-year-old girl with mental retardation, microcephalia and mild diplegia who, in the context of varicella infection, presented extreme muscular weakness and prostration.
Blood and urine tests showed high creatine phosphokinase concentrations and myoglobinuria.
The patient received aggressive intravenous hydration.
Evolution was favorable with no renal failure.
Rhabdomyolysis can produce life-threatening complications such as renal failure, intravascular disseminated coagulation and hyperkaliemia.
The disease can be precipitated by alcohol ingestion, compression injury and generalized seizures.
Infectious etiology is less common.
Few reports have been published on primary varicella- zoster induced rhabdomyolysis but, because creatine phosphokinase concentrations are not routinely performed in varicella infection, very mild cases might have been under- diagnosed.
Despite its rarity, this disease should be considered in cases of infection, since early treatment with hyperhydration can prevent complications.
