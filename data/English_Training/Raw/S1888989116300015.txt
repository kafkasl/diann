Introduction.
Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide, and an approach is necessary due to its high potential for prevention. 
This paper examines the main characteristics of people admitted to hospitals in the Community of Madrid (Spain) with suicidal behaviour, and the factors associated with their hospital mortality.

Material and methods.
A study was conducted on patients with E950-E959 codes of suicide and self-inflicted injuries of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, contained in any diagnostic field of the minimum basic data set at hospital discharge between 2003 and 2013. 
Sociodemographic, clinical and health care variables were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis in the evaluation of factors associated with hospital mortality.

Results.
Hospital suicidal behaviour predominates in women (58.7%) and in middle-age. 
Hospital mortality is 2.2% (1.6% in women and 3.2% in men), increasing with age. 
Mental disorders are detected 3-4 times more in secondary diagnoses. 
The main primary diagnosis (>74%) is poisoning with substances, with lower mortality (∼1%) than injury by hanging and jumping from high places (≥12%), which have the highest numbers. 
Other factors associated with increased mortality include different medical comorbidities and severity of the injury, while length of stay and mental disorders are protective factors. 
Type of hospital, poisoning, and Charlson index are associated differently with mortality in men and women.

Conclusions.
Hospitalised suicidal acts show a low mortality, mainly related to comorbidities and the severity of injuries.
