Objective.
To determine the perception that some general clinical practitioners have about depressive syndrome in a region of Colombia.

Methodology.
The qualitative approach was established as a basis for this study using grounded theory for the description, analysis, and interpretation of data collected in 20 semi-structured interviews aimed at general medical practitioners who had treated patients with depressive syndrome in their clinical practice.

Results.
Throughout the interviews, some essential elements are highlighted such as: “seeing beyond a body,” where the interest of the physician is reflected by individualising each patient case because regardless of having the same disease, knowing that not all can be addressed or treated equally. 
“From insignificant to terrifying” shows that the network of experiences, experiences, emotions, and desires that make up part of the physician, are reflected in the compassion that he has for patient with depression, a situation that makes him confront as a human being before the suffering of others. 
In contrast appears the “my hands are tied” with a health system that prevents proper care of these patients, and generates problems for the treating physician.

Conclusions.
The malleable and unfinished scenario where the physicians interact with the depressive syndrome, allows them to understand their humanity while reflecting on the possibilities, limitations, meanings, attitudes and actions that they have about this disorder that is reflected in the ability of general physicians to diagnose and treat depression that is not necessarily associated with age or experience in practice. 
However, errors in care can be reduced with sufficient knowledge and an appropriate approach to mental illness.
