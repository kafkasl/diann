Abstract
 Introduction
We used data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 to report on the burden of neuropsychiatric disorders in Spain.
Materials and methods
The summary measure of burden used in the study was the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), which sums of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs).
DALYs were adjusted for comorbidity and estimated with 95% uncertainty intervals.
Results
The burden of neuropsychiatric disorders accounted for 18.4% of total all- cause DALYs generated in Spain for 2010.
Within this group, the top five leading causes of DALYs were: depressive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, migraine, substance-use disorders, and anxiety disorder, which accounted for 70.9% of all DALYs due to neuropsychiatric disorders.
Neurological disorders represented 5.03% of total all cause YLLs, whereas mental and substance-use disorders accounted for 0.8%.
Mental and substance-use disorders accounted for 22.4% of total YLDs, with depression being the most disabling disorder.
Neurological disorders represented 8.3% of total YLDs.
Conclusions
Neuropsychiatric disorders were one of the leading causes of disability in 2010.
This finding contributes to our understanding of the burden of neuropsychiatric disorders in the Spanish population and highlights the importance of prioritising neuropsychiatric disorders in the Spanish public health system.
