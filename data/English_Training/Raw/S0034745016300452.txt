Abstract
 Introduction
Hypothyroidism results from inadequate production of thyroid hormone.
It is known that there is a relationship between the major psychiatric disorders and hypothyroidism.
Objective
To determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients admitted due to major psychiatric disorders in Montserrat Hospital during the period from March to October 2010.
Material and methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients admitted to Montserrat Hospital with a primary diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder (major depression, bipolar affective disorder, generalised panic disorder, panic disorder, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, and schizophrenia) in the aforementioned period.
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was performed to assess the evidence of hypothyroidism.
Results
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be 10.5% (95% CI; 5%-16%).
It was 12.5% in anxiety disorder, 11.1% in depressive disorder, with a lower prevalence of 10.3% for bipolar disorder, and 9.9% for schizophrenia.
Conclusions
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be less than in the general population, which is between 4.64% and 18.5%, and hypothyroidism was found in disorders other than depression.
