Abstract
 People with a learning disability are living longer.
This increased longevity brings with it the conditions of older age including dementia.
Amongst people in the general population who have dementia there is inadequate pain recognition and treatment.
Limited research has been undertaken on the pain management needs of people with a learning disability who have dementia, yet they will experience high levels of physical health needs that will, as a consequence, result in pain.
The research study ‘Responding to the Pain needs of People with a Learning Disability and Dementia’ explored the detection, management and understanding of pain amongst a range of professional groups involved in supporting people with a learning disability who have dementia.
The study also recorded the experiences and views of some people with a learning disability who had dementia.
The dilemmas and obstacles to effective pain management were explored.
It was found that the pain experiences and management of people with a learning disability who have dementia mirrored findings in the general population.
The research did, however, identify extra and compounding issues in relation to people with a learning disability.
Drawing on this research this article outlines recommendations for practitioners and service providers and discusses the key lessons for responding more effectively to pain in people with Down’s syndrome and dementia.
