Abstract
 Introduction
We present a statistic study comparing all the options we can take to face congenital deafness as a problem of public health.
Patients and Methods
We collected and analyzed data obtained between 1991 and 1995, just before our universal screening program started.
They were separated into two groups with the 144 children explored using ABR, and the results were compared depending on the option taken in each group (no screening or high risk screening) and finally with those obtained in a universal program.
Results
The establishment of a high risk screening program was followed by a drastic reduction of the severe deafness diagnosis (29â€™5% to 8%), and also of the mean age of diagnosis (24 to 14 months), which were found statistically significant.
The mean age with universal screening is 3 months.
Discussion and conclusions
Early detection of congenital hearing impairment has brought an important advance in the management of this problem of public health minimizing its sequels as the diagnosis is reached earlier.
The universal screening of deafness is feasible as based on cheap and easy diagnostic techniques available in any centre, and it must be performed with the rest of Health Children Programs.
