Introduction
The aim of our study is to describe the types of dementia found in a series of patients and to estimate the level of agreement between the clinical diagnosis and post-mortem diagnosis.
Material and Methods
We conducted a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of the types of dementia found in our series and we established the level of concordance between the clinical and the post-mortem diagnoses. 
The diagnosis was made based on current diagnostic criteria.
Results
114 cases were included. 
The most common clinical diagnoses both at a clinical and autopsy level were Alzheimer disease and mixed dementia but the prevalence was quite different. 
While at a clinical level, prevalence was 39% for Alzheimer disease and 18% for mixed dementia, in the autopsy level, prevalence was 22% and 34%, respectively. 
The agreement between the clinical and the autopsy diagnoses was 62% (95% CI 53-72%).
Conclusions
Almost a third of our patients were not correctly diagnosed in vivo. 
The most common mistake was the underdiagnosis of cerebrovascular pathology.
