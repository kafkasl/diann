Abstract
 We report two cases of sudden deafness which appeared during vaso-occlusive crisis of a sickle cell anaemia (homozygous form of disease) and a sickle cell trait (heterozygous form) in two males aged sixteen and twenty-two, respectively.
A high erythrocyte aggregability and low deformability were proved in both young men.
Although hearing disorders have been reported in this disease, a sudden onset is not common.
The treatment used was useful in the removal of painful crisis and infections, but deafness did not improve in either of then.
