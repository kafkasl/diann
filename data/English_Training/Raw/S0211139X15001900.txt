Abstract
 Background
Ageing has been linked to a high prevalence of cognitive impairment, which, in turn, has been related to balance disturbances and gait disorders.
The aim of this study was to identify whether there are differences between subjects with and without cognitive impairment regarding the quality of gait and balance.
Material and methods
An observational study was conducted on institutionalised people older than 65 years (n = 82).
Gait and balance was evaluated after the assessment of cognitive impairment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Single and dual tests were used including, the 6-minute walking, stride length, and gait speed.
Timed Up and Go tests were also used to evaluate balance.
Results
The participants were divided into three groups: 28 subjects in the group without cognitive impairment (MMSE ≥ 27), 29 subjects with mild (27 < MMSE ≤ 21) and 26 subjects with moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE < 21).
Gait assessment showed significant between-groups differences in all the variables ( _P_ < .05).
The variables assessing balance also showed significantly worse values in those groups with cognitive impairment.
Conclusion
The severity of cognitive impairment is related to impaired balance and gait, thus the clinical monitoring of these variables in population at risk is needed.
