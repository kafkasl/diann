   Summary
Xanthogranulomas of the choroids plexus (XG) are benign tumours of debatable etiology which become rarely symptomatic.
Only few cases have been studied with MRI.
A new case of xanthogranuloma of the third ventricle showing unusual features in the CT and MRI studies in a 47-year-old man with a 2-month history of gait and urinary disturbances and cognitive impairment is reported.
The literature concerning clinical and neuroradiological presentation of intracranial xanthogranulomas is reviewed.
